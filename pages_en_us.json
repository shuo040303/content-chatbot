    "text": "Adding Images to Your Website\n\nStrikingly makes it easy to add images and customize your site’s design. You can add images in various sections or set them as backgrounds. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it: 1. Adding Images in Sections To add images to your site, you can use the Image & Video sections available in the Site Editor. In the Site Editor, click on \"Add New Section\" on the left side of the screen. Under the “ Image & Video ” category, you will see these options: Big Media: Use this section to showcase a large, eye-catching image. It's perfect for displaying a single image that needs to stand out. Banner Slider (Pro feature): This section allows you to create a rotating image banner. It’s available to Pro users and is great for adding multiple images in a slideshow format. Grid: The Grid section lets you display multiple images in a neat, organized layout. Once you’ve selected the section, upload your image(s) and adjust settings as needed. Check more details about our image editor here . 2. Adding Images to Other Sections You can also add images to other sections that support media uploads. Here are some additional sections where you can add images: Gallery Section: Showcase a collection of images in a beautiful, organized layout. To add an image to the gallery, click \"Manage Gallery\" > \"Import Image/Video\" , then select an image from your uploaded files, Strikingly’s library, upload a new image from your device, or add a link to upload an image from the web. Don't forget to click \"Save\" when you're done. Team Section: Display team member photos along with their names and roles to personalize your site. Testimonials Section: Add images of your customers or clients alongside their testimonials for a more credible and engaging design. Feature List Section: Add images to each feature you’re showcasing to make the content visually appealing. Portfolio Section: Perfect for showcasing your work, skills, or products with images that highlight your expertise. Store Section: Add images to your product listings in the store section to attract customers and give a clear view of what you’re selling. Blog Section: Add images to your blog posts as cover images or within the post itself to break up the text and make it more engaging. 3. Adding Images to Backgrounds To make your site more visually appealing, you can also add images to background sections: In the Site Editor, click \"Background\" in the section you want to edit. Click on “Image” and upload the image you want to use as the background. Adjust the settings to make sure the image fits well, like positioning and scaling, for a polished look. Check this article for more details: Adding Background Images. Tips: Make sure the images you upload are high-quality and appropriately sized. Check this article for more details: Image Size Specifications - What is the proper size for an image? Use background images that complement the content in your sections to enhance the overall design. Note: Image size should not exceed 10MB.",

    "text": "Email Domain Authentication (DKIM)\n\nWhen sending emails with Strikingly, you must set a Sender Profile . These details will be shown when the recipient opens your email in their inbox. In the From Email field, you may use a custom email address to send emails from and receive replies. This From Email must follow some important rules: If the email address is on a free service (e.g. Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, Proton), your emails are more likely to be marked as spam! We strongly recommend using a custom domain for this instead. If the email address is on a domain that is managed on Strikingly , you don’t need to do anything else! We’ll handle the validation automatically. If the email address is on a domain that is managed by a third-party registrar (e.g. Godaddy, Namecheap, etc), then you’ll need to add DKIM authentication to your domain in order to properly send emails from that email address. To do this, follow the instructions below. You'll learn how to do the domain authentication (DKIM) exactly in this article.

In this case, you only need to enter the part up to \"_domainkey\" (for CNAME) and \"_amazonses\" (for TXT).

Your From Email address is the address you use to send emails from and receive replies. Due to email regulatory policy, if you use an email address from a free service provider such as @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, or @outlook.com, your emails will have a low delivery rate, because mail services may not accept marketing emails sent from free email addresses. To help you ensure that most of your contacts receive your emails, we will change your From Email to an authenticated address owned by Strikingly. How Strikingly Helps Your Delivery Rates. If you enter a free email address as your From Email , we’ll automatically make a change to your email address each time you send an email. All the changes are on our side, so you can keep using your free email domain and we'll handle the rest. We’ll use the @send.mystrikingly.com subdomains as the From domain for your email address when you send. Replies from the recipient will still go to your original email address. For example, if your email is example@gmail.com , we will modify it to example.gmail.com@send.mystrikingly.com . Note: This solution will help, but it can’t fix all delivery issues. We strongly recommend using a custom domain email (e.g. hello@yourdomain.com) for your From Email, which builds trust with recipients and looks more professional.

Apply to become a Strikingly Affiliate at https://www.strikingly.com/s/affiliate. However, we also have some legacy systems that earned lower commissions. All legacy affiliates should migrate to the latest Affiliate Program to earn the most commissions possible! We will deprecate legacy systems on December 31, 2022. How do I know if I'm using an older system? There are a few ways to check if you're using an older legacy system: If you see an upgrade button on https://www.strikingly.com/s/affiliate , you're using an older system. Or, if your affiliate link starts with a.strk.ly or mbsy.co , you're using an older system. (The latest affiliate link will start with www.strikingly.com/a/ ) Or, if you logged into the affiliate system at https://affiliate.strikingly.com/login, you're using an older system. (The latest affiliate dashboard is https://www.strikingly.com/s/affiliate .) How do I migrate to the newest system? To migrate to our new system, log into Strikingly and visit https://www.strikingly.com/s/affiliate . Make sure you've applied to our newest system. If you see an upgrade button on the dashboard, just click it (\"Earn more commission now\") and follow the instructions on the screen to complete your upgrade. That's it! If your link starts with a.strk.ly or mbsy.co , or if you accessed your affiliate dashboard from https://affiliate.strikingly.com/login, click the \"Migrate from legacy affiliate system\" button in the \"Links & Resources\" section. This tool allows you to migrate existing a.strk.ly links to our new system, so you won't have to change those old links in your promotional content, but they will earn you commissions in our new Affiliate Program. (However, if you have been using mbsy.co links, you will still need to update all the links in your content to your new link.) Just follow the instructions on the screen to migrate to the new system. What is the result of the migration? After migration and approval, you'll be able to earn our increased commissions! Please note that the increased commissions only apply to new referrals that you refer after you have completed the migration. We hope you enjoy being a Strikingly Affiliate. Please contact us at support@strikingly.com if you have any questions!",

Blog Content Blog Article First Site Guide: Strikingly Website Builder Review 2022 👍 Why we like this article: It features us! Obviously :) It’s easy to read, and the language is casual. It doesn’t bombard its audience with big jargon. It features a summary review and an in-depth review. You can get a quick glance at the info that you need, without reading the entire article. The article mentions “9 minutes read” on top. It sets your reader’s expectations if they need to sit down and get a coffee, or they can finish it on their way to the 54th floor of their building. 💡 Idea: Write your own Strikingly website builder review! Customer Service Software Showdown: Zendesk vs. Freshdesk 👍 Why we like this article: It features a detailed list of features that were used to compare the 2 products in the beginning. This one easily tells the reader if they can find the information that they need within the article. A comparison table is a great way to summarize the differences between two products. The title became catchy with the word “showdown” – it deviated from the generic “Product vs. Other Product Comparison: 2022” title formats. 💡 Idea: Strikingly Pro Vs Strikingly VIP: Who Wins This Party? Taking Advantage of Typeform’s Explosive Growth 👍 Why we like this article: The “Results” at the beginning of the article engages the readers to read more about how they can achieve the same. The entire blog post is based on personal experience. People love being personal. There’s an offer at the end of the article, “Get early access” – it’s like your bonus after reading through the entire thing! 💡 Idea: “Join the Strikingly Revolution: Get Your Biz Online in 20 Minutes or Less” Blog articles are useful content to show your audience that you’re a trusted source, and drive traffic to your website. When you write blog posts, remember: Write eye-catching headlines. Choose your words carefully, and when possible, use trending languages/terms for better relatability. Always add a summary. The beginning or the ending doesn’t matter–TLDR is real especially when the article is too long. Share personal experiences. Being personal creates a meaningful connection between you and your audience. Be yourself. Social Media Posts Facebook Sorav Jain Views: 387 Likes: 25 Comments: 21 👍 Why we like this post: The story is very relatable and witty! Imagine getting girlfriends on Instagram–who would even think that was possible? It offers great advice on how to use Instagram to grow your business. 💡 Idea: Create your own funny and witty story, or maybe share a friend’s and offer tips on how to grow their business with a website. Introducing UI/UX Design Course Likes: 869 Comments: 405 Shares: 123 👍 Why we like this post: The image is catchy with the most striking color in the middle. The details of the course are included in the post. 💡 Idea: Offer your own website-building course on Facebook! Intuit Likes: 7.8K Comments: 172 Shares: 180 👍 Why we like this post: It focuses on its audience–how everyone should focus on themselves and their careers. They also made a public commitment to support their employees, something that everyone wants. It was timely. The post was added in January, New Year’s, a time when people write their own resolutions (but never really do–for some). 💡 Idea: Create your own New Year’s Resolution list and include building a website Facebook continues to be the reigning champion for social media websites. It’s still a great space to keep your audience informed and in the loop. When you create posts, keep an eye out for: Nice graphics. Facebook is viewed on mobile devices and desktop computers. Your images should look nice, so keep an eye out for your image pixels! Timeliness. Time your posts depending on the season, and days. Here’s a quick tip on when’s the best time to post on Facebook. Twitter @github Comments: 8 Retweets: 102 Likes: 352 👍 Why we like this post: It’s the first release for the new year. People are always excited about new features, and the post is just timely. The bold yet plain share image is enough to make the audience stop when they scroll through their Twitter feed. 💡 Idea: Compile Strikingly’s new feature releases (we release new features every week!) and tweet it as a thread every month! @SauravPurohit4 Comments: 35 Retweets: 504 Likes: 1.8K 👍 Why we like this post: It's a personal testimonial and inspiration. This person introduced himself, then proceeded to share websites where his audience can get website design inspiration. Recommendations are gold on social media, especially from experts. “10 websites” was mentioned in the first tweet. Unlike other threads that seem to just go on and on, the audience expectations are set properly. 💡 Idea: Create your own personal testimonial like, “I am a Strikingly expert..” and list down your favorite features. @infospikedotcom Comments: 19 Retweets: 642 Likes: 1,866 👍 Why we like this post: It’s bold and creates a very strong statement. It resonates with her audience well. The post answers the most common questions posted by anyone who wants to have his/her own business. Who doesn’t want these questions answered? Encourages everyone to ask questions–the first rule of engagement. Ask. 💡 Idea: Create bold statements and answer basic website-building questions Twitter is a place where most brands and businesses try to dig deeper into their target audience's interests. When you make tweets, here are a few reminders: Build your profile first. Follow relevant people and grow your audience. Don’t try to sell all the time. Offer value and advice. Add humor. People don’t like being sales talked. Always use the right hashtags to reach more people. Instagram HubSpot Likes: 2,773 Comments: 134 👍 Why we like this post: The graphics are clean, and the important elements are in big, bold letters. The post shows a number that is presented as a fact. Using numbers to make claims is better than just stating the fact. It’s just more believable. The post makes sense, and it’s something that people actually experience. Ads are more personalized because it resonates with people’s stories. Add that with a number and shazam! Powerful message. 💡 Idea: Find an interesting website/startup/e-commerce statistic online, make a graphic, and post it on IG. Something like, “44% of small businesses plan to have a website in 2021.” Simplydigital.gr Views: 62K Comments: 82 👍 Why we like this post: It’s him again! Tiktok-type videos are just perfect anywhere because they are so easy to consume because they’re short. Just like his TikTok videos, he introduces his content in the first few seconds. His information is really valuable because it benefits everyone, not just a specific type of person. His video feels amateurish, and it works. Anyone who watches his video feels like they can do the same exact video without any professional skills or help. Again, relatable. 💡 Idea: 6 Strikingly Features I Am Obsessed With Marketingharry Likes: 1,302 Comments: 213 👍 Why we like this post: It’s a list, but it’s not the usual list. A tad creative in terms of presentation, but it didn’t sacrifice the message that it wants to get across. The description is a summary of the information on the image. If you can’t read the image (Because small device screen? Looking at you, iPhone 13 mini), you’d still be compelled because of the “teaser” on the description. It’s how to make money ON INSTAGRAM, posted on INSTAGRAM. It’s not how to make money on Instagram, posted on Facebook. It makes total sense. 💡 Idea: 8 Ways how to market your website on Instagram UI/UX Design Trends Likes: 2,108 Comments: 28 👍 Why we like this post: The graphics are such eye candies! 😍 They didn’t cram all information in one image. They created a series of images that created anticipation. “Trends” + Current Year = Very timely post. 💡 Idea: Website design trends in 2022 (and showcase screenshots of actual Strikingly websites) Instagram is highly visual, but you don’t need a very visual product to market on IG. When you create posts, always do the following: Create well-crafted photos and visuals. There are a lot of free tools out there for you to use, so use them! Use Instagram Stories–they come in slideshow formats, and they always appear on top of your follower timelines. Add video shorts. Videos are perfect for every social media channel. Pinterest 26 Things to Note Before You Develop a Website - Infographic Repins: 4,772 Save: 4772 Likes: 782 Comments: 9 👍 Why we like this pin: It’s an infographic with so much info included in one image. It doesn’t link me anywhere else. Pinterest can be a rabbit hole for links when all you need is an image. 💡 Idea: “10 Things to Prepare Before You Build a Website” (yeah, 26 can be too much) Damn LOL is coming soon Repins: 4,701 Save: 31,243 Likes: 2,025 Comments: 19 👍 Why we like this pin: It features an amazing product–real or not. It shows how the product works without using any words or text. The product details are clear, like a product manual. Very straightforward in communicating information. 💡 Idea: Create an anatomy of the Strikingly website builder–show how easy it is to use. 5 things you must do before making money with your blog Repins: 3,658 Save: 3,658 Likes: 642 Comments: 7 👍 Why we like this pin: The title features 2 keywords: 5 and money. Five (5) means it’s a short list, and money means that people can earn from it. People love short lists on how to earn. Pinterest is used as a jump-off point to a blog post. This is useful to drive more traffic on your website or blog. 💡 Idea: Top 5 ways to make money from your Strikingly site. Pinterest is a platform known for finding new ideas or sharing your new ideas. It’s not the usual social media platform where you upload images of your recent vacation or catch up with friends. This implies that people who are on Pinterest are actively searching for new things. When you make pins, make sure that you: Turn your ideas into inspiring, engaging content. Your images should tell the story of your article or brand. Add context. Use a mix of images, videos, and blog posts. Videos do well in any social media platform, but images are really defaulted and can be easily repinned. Don’t forget to add your link! Other Content Online Courses Free Course: Beginner Web Design using HTML5, CSS3 & Visual Studio Code Views: 1,414,371 views Likes: 35K Comments: 1,907 👍 Why we like this course: It’s free! We’re all suckers for free. Even exercise files can be downloaded absolutely free. It feels like an actual course because it’s 4 hours–like your extended college class over the weekend. Although the video is 4 hours long, it’s a teaser for an entire course (28 videos) that can be accessed via a monthly subscription. 💡 Idea: Create one (1) free online course on how to create a website on Strikingly, and a series of paid courses that features how to set up powerful e-commerce, or gain more traffic for your Strikingly e-commerce store. SEO success with Tim Soulo: Tips for Course creators Views: 68K Likes: 62 👍 Why we like this course: It’s an interactive course in an interview format. It’s more interactive than just one person speaking. The course is short at 39:34 minutes. The introduction didn’t even take 1 minute! Some course creators spend minutes introducing themselves and their sponsors–boring. 💡 Idea: Get a friend and have this friend interview you about creating websites on Strikingly. Prepare a script if you need to but make it look more spontaneous. Free Canva Beginner’s Course Students: Over 10,000 people completed the course 👍 Why we like this course: It’s a free course, and it’s very easy to sign up. It has its own website page, but the courses are done via a Facebook Group. This is something that you can also replicate. The course only takes an hour. Not too long, and I don’t have to set aside half of my day to finish an entire course. 💡 Idea: Create your own website with Strikingly, offer a free course, and share your affiliate link with your students. Online courses are a great way to sell Strikingly to your audience because you're not just selling them Strikingly, you're also teaching them a new set of skills. You can also monetize your course content by creating a series. When you go this route, always remember to: Always create an outline and include it in your video or comments. This way, your audience knows exactly what they will learn. Provide good visuals and screen shares. A blurry video will make elements hard to read, and your students won't know what you're clicking. Provide exercises. This will stimulate learning and will make your students feel like \"actual students\" who are actually learning something. Q&A Websites Quora: There are tons of website builders out there (Wix, Strikingly, WordPress, and the list goes on!). Which one of them do I know is the best fit for my startup? 👍 Why we like this post: The “asker” asked a valid question. With tons of options out there, how do you choose the right website builder for your startup? It’s an open platform, and anyone can answer. 💡 Idea: Respond to questions of this sort. Either include a link to your website where your affiliate link is, or add your own affiliate link to your response. Reddit: In 18 months, I went from no coding experience to selling apps to the NBA, NHL, and Berkshire Hathaway. Then, I released my code under a public license. 2-year follow-up, AMA! 👍 Why we like this post: The post is a testimonial–how the Redditor who had no idea how to code went to selling apps and got rich from it. He documented his story. People love success stories. And they always derive lessons from somebody else’s experience. 💡 Idea: Document your affiliate marketing journey with Strikingly: from day 1 to your first sale. Product Hunt: Startup Stash 👍 Why we like this post: A very useful list of applications that are useful for startups. Startups are the core drivers of innovation–and they are everywhere! They’re also looking for tools. It’s an open thread, and anyone can comment. 💡 Idea: Respond to posts about startup tools, or create your own list and post it on different forums. Q&A Websites allow you to create quality backlinks to your website or affiliate link just by answering questions. When you answer questions, make sure that you: Only answer relevant questions. The goal is to get your answer upvoted, so it always shows up on top with your link. Avoid looking spammy by answering irrelevant questions. Keep it subtle. Don't sound too sales-y. People don't want to be sales talked about all the time. Respond to responses on your answer. This creates engagement and people are more to trust you.",

III. Company’s Responsibilities to Affiliate The Company’s sole responsibility to the Affiliate under this Agreement is to pay the appropriate Referral Fees to an Affiliate who is in good standing and is rightfully credited with a Qualified Purchase according to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. IV. Payouts Affiliates are entitled to receive Payouts from Strikingly in accordance with this section. In general, Strikingly provides each Affiliate with an Affiliate Link, which the Affiliate presents to Visitors in order to click the link and navigate to a Strikingly Site to sign up for services there. If a Visitor last accesses the Strikingly Site via an Affiliate Link before registering for an account on Strikingly, the Affiliate associated with that link is credited with a Last Click, which is recorded by a cookie given to the Visitor that resides on the Visitor’s browser for up to 180 days. If that Visitor becomes a Premium Subscriber while the cookie is active, that constitutes a Qualified Purchase and makes the associated Affiliate eligible for a Referral Fee, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. A. Delayed Credit for First Qualified Purchase The first Qualified Purchase that is credited to an Affiliate does not immediately count toward that Affiliate’s Referral Fees. Since Affiliates often generate their first would-be referral by self-referring (which is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement), Strikingly does not award any Referral Fees for the first Qualified Purchase for any Affiliate, whether they are in fact prohibited self-referrals or not. No Referral Fees will be attributed to an Affiliate who has only referred one (1) Premium Subscriber. To receive any Payouts or Referral Fees, each Affiliate must refer at least two (2) Premium Subscribers. Upon referral of the second Premium Subscriber who makes a Qualified Purchase, Strikingly will review the Affiliate’s referrals and credit any and all subscriptions referred by the Affiliate under this Agreement. B. Qualified Purchases When an Affiliate is credited with a Qualified Purchase, that credit will appear on the Affiliate’s Dashboard. Not every Qualified Purchase results in a Referral Fee. Strikingly gives new Premium Subscribers a Trial Period, a period during which they may cancel their subscription contracts without penalty. Affiliates who refer new Premium Subscribers that make Qualified Purchases only earn a Referral Fee if the new Premium Subscribers do not cancel during the trial period. C. Validation Period After the Premium Subscriber’s Trial Period ends, a Validation Period runs during which Strikingly ensures that the Premium Subscriber does not dispute or cancel their account shortly after signing up. During the Validation Period, Strikingly verifies that each new Premium Subscriber sign-up is valid and not fraudulent before approving payment of the Referral Fee. If the Premium User disputes any payment during the Validation Period, then the associated Referral Fee will be canceled, regardless of the outcome of said dispute. The length of the Validation Period may vary depending on the subscription term of the Premium Subscriber’s plan. More information about the duration of the various Validation Periods is available on your Affiliate dashboard on the Strikingly Website. During the Validation Period, Strikingly may investigate each Qualified Purchase for any Inappropriate Activity. Any breach of this Agreement by the Affiliate is grounds for Strikingly’s denial of payment of Referral Fees. If Strikingly determines, in its sole discretion, that there may be some other basis for denial, then Strikingly will delay payment of the Referral Fee until Strikingly determines that the referral is valid and the corresponding fee should be approved, or that there was some Inappropriate Activity and/or that the Referral Fee should be denied. In the event that Strikingly determines that there may be some basis for denial, or if Strikingly has any concerns about whether the Referral Fee should be approved, then Strikingly may ask for additional information regarding the transaction in question. Failure to provide this information promptly will cause any payment to be further delayed or, if the information is not timely provided, to be canceled. Without excluding any of the other basis for denial, and with the caveat that Strikingly does not have to provide or state a basis for denial when denying Referral Fees, the following list is provided as a shorthand reminder to Affiliates of the types of conduct considered to be the sort of Inappropriate Activity that will generally result in the denial of Referral Fees: Fraud or Other Misconduct False or Abusive Advertising Tax Non-Compliance Self-Invitations Double Attributions Cookie Stuffing Kickbacks Cancellations During the Trial or Validation Period Breach of This Agreement Additionally, if an Affiliate refers an unusually large number or percentage of Premium Subscribers who dispute payments, it will be grounds for Strikingly to terminate this Agreement with the Affiliate for the cause. Only after Strikingly has verified each Qualified Purchase will Referral Fees for such Qualified Purchase be credited to the Affiliate Dashboard. D. Payout of Referral Fees Strikingly pays Affiliate’s Referral Fees upon request by the Affiliate only when the Affiliate is in good standing and has the Minimum Payment Amount accrued in Referral Fees. The current Minimum Payment Amount is displayed in the Affiliate Dashboard. (For example, if the Minimum Payment Amount is currently $25, and You have earned only $22 in Referral Fees, then You are not eligible to request payment; on the other hand, if you have earned $28 in Referral Fees, then you are able to request to be paid $25 to $28.) Strikingly will pay Your Referral Fee via the Payment Agent. In order to receive Your Referral Fee, You must have a valid account with the Payment Agent that is properly set up and in good standing. If you have accrued the Minimum Payment Amount in your total Referral Fees, then you may request a Payout via the Affiliate Dashboard. 1. Rates The rates of the Referral Fees for a Qualified Purchase depend on the type of plan that the referred Premium Subscriber selects and on any promotions that Strikingly is running at that time. Due to the dynamic nature of rates and rate changes, please visit Your personalized Affiliate Dashboard on the Strikingly website to see Your current rates. 2. Timing Strikingly will pay the accrued Referral Fees to the Affiliate within thirty (30) days of receiving a valid request for a Payout. E. Conditions of Payment All payments of the Referral Fees will be due and payable in United States Dollars only, except as otherwise determined by Strikingly in its sole discretion. Payment will be made against a valid invoice issued by Affiliate, through its Payment Agent or any other method chosen by Strikingly, in its sole discretion. Affiliate is responsible to provide Strikingly with full and accurate details as required for it to remit the Referral Fees, and shall be solely liable for any delay in payment resulting from its failure to duly and timely provide Strikingly with such details. In the event of any activity deemed suspicious by Strikingly at its sole determination, Strikingly may delay payment of the Referral Fees to Affiliate for up to sixty (60) days to verify the relevant transactions. In the event that Strikingly determines the activity to constitute fraud, it shall recalculate or withhold the Referral Fees accordingly and in its sole discretion. It is hereby clarified that in any event that Strikingly shall determine that Affiliate has acted in violation of this Agreement or is involved, directly or indirectly, in any fraudulent, deceptive, manipulative, or otherwise illegal activity connected to Strikingly, including without limitation to the Strikingly Site, Affiliate Links and/or Users, Strikingly shall have the right, in addition to any other right or remedy available to it under this Agreement or applicable law, to render the Affiliate Links assigned to such Affiliate inoperative, and immediately block Affiliate access to the Program, with no compensation to Affiliate. Affiliate hereby irrevocably waives any claim or demand against Strikingly, its directors, officers, shareholders, or employees in respect of such action taken by Strikingly. F. Taxes The Affiliate is responsible for the payment of all taxes applicable to the conduct of the Affiliate’s business. The payment to the Affiliate shall be subject to any withholding tax obligations applicable by law. It is agreed that the Referral Fees are inclusive of any and all taxes applicable by any law, including VAT (if applicable). G. Garnishment If, for any reason, a Referral Fee is paid prior to discovering that fee should have been denied for one of the reasons provided above, then Strikingly will deduct an amount equal to the improperly paid fee from any future payments of fees to that Affiliate. H. Clawbacks of Referral Fees Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement to the contrary, any incentive-based compensation, or any other compensation, paid to the Affiliate pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement or arrangement with the Company or any related party, which is subject to recovery under any law, or government regulation, will be subject to such deductions and clawback as may be required to be made pursuant to such law, government regulation (or any policy adopted by the Company pursuant to any such law, government regulation). I. Changes to Referral Fees Strikingly may change the pricing, policies, and operating procedures at any time consistent with applicable laws. For example, Strikingly will determine the prices to be charged for services in accordance with Strikingly’s own pricing policies. In the event that such changes affect items that Affiliate already has presented on the Affiliate Site, the Ads, or any other information provided by Affiliate to third parties in respect to this Agreement and its participation in the Program, Affiliate will be required to track such changes and reflect them in the Affiliate’s Site or in any other relevant marketing means. J. Non-Active Affiliates Non-Active Affiliates are not entitled to any fees or payments for recurring Referral Fees that would otherwise have accrued while being a Non-Active Affiliate. (For example, if You referred a new user who signed up as a Premium Subscriber for Strikingly’s yearly plan on January 1, 2018, and then You took no further action as an Affiliate which led to Qualified Purchases, You will not be entitled to receive any Referral Fee if the new user you referred renews his annual plan for another year on January 1, 2019, because you will be a Non-Active Affiliate, and Non-Active Affiliates are not eligible to earn Referral Fees on returning customers.) 1. No Payouts for Non-Active Affiliates Non-Active Affiliates may not request Payouts. If you are a Non-Active Affiliate and if you believe that you have earned Referral Fees for which you would otherwise be entitled to payment, you may either become an active Affiliate via Reactivation, or you may contact Strikingly directly and ask us to review your case and to make an expectation where we might, without thereby waiving any of our rights under this Agreement, may agree to make your fee payment despite your non-active status. 2. Reactivation Non-Active Affiliates may be Reactivated by referring new Premium Subscribers who make a Qualified Purchase of Strikingly Services. Upon Reactivation, the Affiliate will once again be able to request payments (subject to the conditions listed above) and will once again receive Referral Fees for new subscribers and for any renewals of Premium Subscribers that Affiliate is credited for signing up after the Reactivation. To be clear, once an Affiliate becomes a Non-Active Affiliate, that Affiliate will not be entitled to receive any recurring Referral Fee fees for renewals of accounts that signed up prior to the Affiliate becoming a Non-Active Affiliate. All recurring Referral Fees that have not yet come due for renewals become forever null and void once an Affiliate becomes a Non-Active Affiliate. V. Affiliate Admission This Section describes how You may be Admitted to and remain in the Program. No one shall be deemed an Affiliate unless and until the admission processes described in this section are completed. A. Applicant and Application To begin the enrollment process, the Applicant must submit an Application. Applicant must provide full, true, and accurate information in the Application. Strikingly will evaluate the Application in good faith and may notify Applicant of acceptance or rejection within approximately thirty (30) business days. Unless Applicant receives a clear written notice from Strikingly confirming Applicant’s admission in the Program, Applicant shall not be deemed to be part of the Program. B. Rejection Strikingly may reject any Application if Strikingly determines, in Strikingly’s sole discretion, that the Affiliate Site or any Affiliate Activities is unsuitable for the Program for any reason. If Strikingly accepts Affiliate Application and thereafter the Affiliate Site or activity is determined (in Strikingly’s sole discretion) to be unsuitable for the Program, Strikingly may terminate the Affiliate’s participation in the Program at any time. Unsuitable Affiliate Sites or activities may include, but not be limited to, the Site Restrictions described above. Strikingly shall not be required to provide any explanation for its rejection of any prospective Affiliate. C. Age Restriction You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age to join the Program. By submitting an Affiliate Application, You represent and warrant that You are at least eighteen (18) years of age and may legally agree to this agreement. The Company assumes no responsibility or liability for The misrepresentation of Your age. D. Identity Verification The Company may require You to verify Your identity as a condition of Your enrollment into the Program. By submitting an Application, You represent and warrant that any identity information You provide is true, correct, and complete. The Company assumes no responsibility or liability for The misrepresentation of Your identity. E. Privacy Policy Strikingly’s Privacy Policy is considered part of this Agreement. By executing this agreement, You acknowledge that You have read and accepted Strikingly’s Privacy Policy. F. Reapplication Rejection of an Application by Strikingly shall not derogate from the Affiliate’s right to reapply to the Program at any other time thereafter, provided that the Affiliate complies with the provisions of this Agreement. G. Admission The applicant shall be deemed Admitted and therefore be an Affiliate only when and if the Company has pronounced this in writing to the Applicant. VI. Affiliate Responsibilities (Affirmative Covenants) Once the Affiliate is admitted, for the Affiliate to continue to comply with the requirements of the Program, Affiliate shall fulfill the responsibilities to the Company listed in this section. Any failure to fulfill these responsibilities may constitute a breach of this Agreement and may be grounds for dismissal from the Program and termination of this Agreement. A. Use Affiliate Links Properly To permit accurate tracking, reporting, and Referral Fee accrual, Strikingly will provide Affiliate with a specific Affiliate Link, which is a unique hyperlink that identifies who directed a Visitor to the Strikingly website. Affiliate must ensure that each of the links between its Affiliate Site and the Strikingly Site properly utilizes the Affiliate Links provided to Affiliate. The affiliate may use Affiliate Links within Emails that the Affiliate sends to registered users of the Affiliate Site. 1. Do Not Modify Affiliate Links Affiliate is not authorized to alter, modify or change any of the Affiliate Links. Affiliate will only earn payments in accordance with the Affiliate Dashboard, which is the Affiliate’s user interface on the Strikingly Site where referrals, payments, and other key performance indicators and data about Affiliate activity are presented. Strikingly will not be held liable to the Affiliate with respect to any failure by the Affiliate to use such Affiliate Links. Strikingly will not be responsible for errors that may occur in the tracking of transactions if the Affiliate has made or caused any such modification to the Affiliate Link. 2. No Other Uses of Affiliate Links For the avoidance of doubt, the Affiliate will use the Affiliate Link only for the purposes of the Program. Any other use of the Affiliate Link will be considered void. Improper use of an Affiliate Link constitutes a material and total breach of this Agreement. B. Use Strikingly Marks Properly From time to time, Strikingly may provide Affiliates with an Ad that contains Strikingly Mark(s). When this occurs, Strikingly grants to Affiliate a License to use these Strikingly Mark(s) for the sole purpose of obtaining Qualified Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement. The affiliate may not use any of the Strikingly Marks in any manner other than as contained in the Ads. Furthermore, the Affiliate may not modify any of the Ads in any way, whatsoever unless approved in advance and in writing by Strikingly. The License shall expire upon the expiration or termination of the Affiliation Term. 1. Use Ads in Good Taste Affiliate shall display the Ads in good taste, adjacent to any with the first or most prominent use of such Ads in a piece of advertising means, in which such Ads appear, subject to other requirements as Strikingly may from time to time impose and provide to Affiliate, including Strikingly trademark guidelines. The affiliate may not use the Ads, and the Strikingly Marks contained therewith in a manner that, in Strikingly’s sole discretion, is disparaging or otherwise portrays Strikingly in a negative light. Affiliate shall have no other right, title, or interest in or to the Ads and Strikingly Marks contained therewith other than as specified in the limited License granted herein. 2. Treat Strikingly as the Owner of Strikingly Marks As between Affiliate and Strikingly, Strikingly shall own all rights, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Strikingly Site, the Program, and Strikingly Marks. Strikingly may at any time, without prior notice, require the Affiliate to remove or modify the Ads, or dynamically replace the Strikingly creative or text with creative or text suitable to Strikingly in Strikingly’s sole discretion. 3. Disclose Affiliate Participation Affiliate shall include in its Affiliate Site, in its Affiliate Emails, and in any other means by which Affiliate is promoting Strikingly, a disclosure conveying that Affiliate participates in Affiliation programs which may reward Affiliate with monetary compensation in connection with the referral of Visitors to advertisers and other third parties. Such disclosure must be in a prominent and easily accessible place and shall be in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. VII. Affiliate Prohibitions (Negative Covenants) Once accepted to the Program, Affiliate hereby agrees not to do anything or take any action that may harm Strikingly. In particular, Affiliates are prohibited from taking inappropriate actions listed in this section; however, this is not meant to be an exclusive list, and other actions which are not specifically contemplated here but which are harmful to the Company or its interests are likewise prohibited. A. No Violation of Laws While it is important for Affiliates to comply with all laws, this Agreement cannot possibly detail all the legal obligations that Affiliates must obey. However, the Company identified the following Marketing Laws as especially important for Affiliates to understand and obey, especially Privacy Laws. B. Market Responsibly and Compliantly If Affiliate sends or causes to be sent, any electronic messages in connection with this Agreement and/or the Affiliate Program, then Affiliate agrees, acknowledges, represents, and warrants that all such messages shall be in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the use of electronic messages, including Marketing Laws, Privacy Laws, and any other similar laws pronounced by any authority in a jurisdiction that may assert authority over that message. C. DO NOT SPAM Strikingly expressly forbids Affiliates from sending Spam. You cannot use Spam when You are promoting Strikingly. Prohibited SPAM includes, but is not limited to: sending, initiating, or procuring the sending of an Email to any person who has either not explicitly requested to receive such messages (or has explicitly requested to receive no further Emails) specifically from Affiliate, including without limitation for the purposes of sending unsolicited bulk email, executing any “mass mailings” or “email blasts,” or for the purpose of spamming any public forum, including without limitation, any blog, message board, classified listings, auction sites, altnet, newsnet, newsgroups, or similar services; employing any false or deceptive information regarding Affiliate’s identity, or regarding the intent, subject, or origin of the message or failing to include accurate information regarding the Affiliate’s identity, and the intent, subject, and origin of the Email; exploiting documented or undocumented security holes on any client or server machine; failing to (i) include clear, valid, and conspicuously displayed “From” and “Subject” lines in the Email, (ii) include a functioning return address (or hyperlink) in the Email that enables the recipient to submit an Opt-Out Request for no less than thirty (30) days from the date the Email was sent; or (iii) honor any Opt-Out Request within ten (10) days of receipt of such Opt-out request by Affiliate; obtaining Email addresses via automated means or sending any Email to any address which was obtained via automated means, including via the automated combination of names, letters, or numbers, dictionary attacks, or the use of spyware, viruses, or other means of bypassing system security or invading consumer privacy; employing any fraudulent, deceptive, false, or misleading information in connection with the Emails; or sending any commercial marketing Email or promotion to, or collecting any personally identifiable information from, any person who is under eighteen (18) years of age. These are just examples of Spam, not an exhaustive list. Use judgment in sending electronic messages to avoid sending anything that could be labeled as Spam. D. No Phone or Text Solicitation You may not solicit users to Strikingly services by calling people on the phone or sending text messages to cell phone numbers, regardless of whether You use an auto-dialer. Phone and text solicitations are expressly forbidden. E. No Privacy Violations Affiliates must comply with all Privacy Laws when handling protected information. Affiliates are independently responsible for ensuring their own compliance with all laws, including Privacy Laws. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Strikingly harmless for any of Your violations or alleged violations of any Privacy Laws. As a precondition to becoming an Affiliate, You must read, understand, and agree to the Strikingly Privacy Policy . To maintain Your status as an Affiliate You must also read, understand, and agree to any modifications to the Privacy Policy. If You disagree with the Privacy Policy in any way at any time, You must notify the company in writing that You want to terminate this Affiliate Agreement; otherwise, the version of the Privacy Policy that is currently adopted by the Company will govern Your rights under Privacy Laws. In addition, You must consent to use Affiliate Links appropriately and as permitted by this Agreement. F. No Usurpation of Strikingly Marks An Affiliate may not pretend that it is Strikingly or otherwise misdirect traffic to any Affiliate Site. This includes a prohibition of the following activities: Using, procuring, bidding on, or otherwise arranging for an advertisement displayed on a search engine’s results page after a user performs a keyword search that uses or includes any of the Strikingly Marks; Purchasing any domain name that includes any Strikingly Marks; and Accumulating, amassing, squatting, hoarding, stockpiling, investing in, selling, laundering, or otherwise obtaining or holding any domains that might appear to be Strikingly Marks or to otherwise belong to Strikingly. In general, you may not do anything that could cause confusion between You and the Company. G. Other Prohibited Activity While it is impossible to discuss every prohibited activity, and while doing so is not necessary because Affiliates owe Strikingly a duty of good faith and fair dealing that prohibits any wrongful conduct that is not in the spirit of this agreement, the following list of prohibited activities are examples of behavior that is de facto and presumptively wrongful. These behaviors and all similar and otherwise wrongful behaviors are prohibited by this Agreement and will constitute a breach of this Agreement and be grounds for termination from this Program. No Purchased Links. The affiliate may not purchase direct ads that contain an Affiliate Link or any link that directly leads to Strikingly Site. The affiliate may not purchase direct ads that contain any Strikingly Marks. Affiliate Links may be placed only on websites or content that an Affiliate owns or creates. No Kickbacks.

No Auto-Filling. The affiliate may not record, redirect, read, or fill in on behalf of any Visitor, Referred User, or Premium Subscriber the contents of any electronic form or other material submitted to Strikingly by any such person. The affiliate may not register any such person to the Strikingly Site or to any Premium Package, on behalf of such person. No Pop-Ups. Affiliate shall not post Affiliate Link or other content promoting the Strikingly Site within any pop-up or pop-under windows. No iFraming or Cookie Stuffing. Affiliate shall not use cookie stuffing techniques that set the Affiliate tracking cookie without the Referred User's knowledge (e.g. iframing). The affiliate may not steal users’ information, hack users’ system, or “cookie stuff” (placing a cookie on a third-party user’s browser without actually encouraging that user to visit the target website in order to earn Referral Fees from the target website) users. No False Claims. Affiliate is prohibited from making inaccurate, deceptive, or otherwise misleading claims about Strikingly and the Strikingly services. No Deceptive Practices. Affiliate shall not engage in any practice that generates traffic to the Affiliate Link through illegal, false, deceptive, or bad faith practices, or engage in any effort to deceive or defraud the Company or potential new users, regardless of whether or not such practice actually causes harm to Strikingly. No Sowing Confusion. Affiliate is prohibited from (i) taking any action that may cause Affiliate Site's Visitors to be confused between the Affiliate’s Site and Strikingly or the Strikingly Site, or (ii) misrepresenting the relationship between Affiliate and Strikingly.

Responsibility for Your Agents In the event that any entity, including any employee, agent, subcontractor, or representative of Affiliate participates in the Program or otherwise acts on behalf of Affiliate with respect thereto, Affiliate shall ensure that such person fully complies with the terms of this Agreement, and Affiliate shall be fully liable for any act or omission of such person. F. No Infringement Affiliate hereby represents and warrants to Strikingly that materials posted on Affiliate’s Site do not violate or infringe upon the rights of any third party and that any materials posted on Affiliate’s Site are not libelous or otherwise illegal nor may cause Affiliate to violate any of its representations and obligations under this Agreement. Strikingly disclaims all liability for all such matters. G. Compliance with Law As a condition to Affiliate’s participation in the Program, Affiliate hereby represents and warrants that during the Term of this Agreement, Affiliate will comply with all laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, licenses, permits, judgments, decisions, or other requirements of any governmental authority as applicable to Affiliate, whether those laws are now in effect or later come into effect during the Term of this Agreement. H. Indemnification Affiliate will indemnify, defend and hold Strikingly, its subsidiaries, officers, employees, agents, and third parties harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, losses, costs, damages, or expenses (including attorney’s fees) arising, directly or indirectly, in connection with Affiliate’s operations or Affiliate’s Site or out of any disputes between Affiliate and any other party relating to this agreement, the participation in this Program, or the site(s) or the services provided by Strikingly. I. Duly Executed This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Affiliate (by acceptance of its terms) and constitutes Affiliate’s legal, valid, and binding obligation, enforceable against Affiliate in accordance with the terms contained herein.

K. No Actions To the best of Affiliate’s knowledge, there is no pending threatened claim, action, or proceeding against Affiliate, or any Affiliate thereof, with respect to the execution, delivery, or consummation of this Agreement, or with respect to any intellectual property infringement, and, to the best of Your knowledge, there is no basis for any such claim, action or proceeding. L. Changes Affiliate understands that Strikingly may at any time (directly or indirectly) solicit customer referrals on terms that may differ from those contained in this Agreement or operate sites that are similar to or compete with the Affiliate Site. M. Monitoring Strikingly has the right, in Strikingly’s sole discretion, to monitor Affiliate Site at any time and from time to time to determine if the Affiliate is in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Any deviations from the guidelines and treatment described in this Agreement must be approved in advance and in writing by Strikingly.

However, if You submit such things to Strikingly, then You grant Strikingly a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license that is sub-licensable and transferable, to make, use, sell, have made, offer to sell, import, reproduce, publicly display, distribute, modify, or publicly perform what you provide in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. O. Independent Investigation Strikingly encourages Affiliates to consult with legal and/or financial and/or tax and/or accounting advisors prior to entering the Program. Affiliate agrees and acknowledges that Affiliate has had ample opportunities to review this agreement thoroughly and to seek independent legal advice in the investigation of the terms of this agreement. Affiliate acknowledges and agrees that nothing herein and no statement by Strikingly or any of its employees or other persons associated with Strikingly has prevented Affiliate in any way from seeking such advice before entering into this Agreement. Affiliate has independently evaluated the desirability of participating in the Program, and Affiliate is not relying on any representations or statements other than as set forth in this Agreement. P. Notification You have an obligation to notify the Company in writing of any violations of Your responsibilities, any changes to Your representations or warranties, or any other event that may cause liability, harm, or damage to the Company. Q. READ THIS CAREFULLY THE AFFILIATE HAS READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, UNDERSTANDS IT, HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH COUNSEL ABOUT IT, AND ACCEPTS THE OBLIGATIONS IT CREATES. AFFILIATE HAS ESPECIALLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, INDEMNIFICATION, ARBITRATION, AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT PRIOR TO ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT. NO PROMISES OR REPRESENTATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE AFFILIATE TO INDUCE THE AFFILIATE TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT. AFFILIATE AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT VOLUNTARILY AND FREELY. IX. Strikingly’s Disclaimers Except as expressly set forth in this agreement, it is understood and agreed that Strikingly is not making and has not made at any time any representations or warranties. A. No Warranties Strikingly makes no express or implied warranties or representations with respect to the agreement, the program and the information to be delivered pursuant hereto. Including, without limitation, warranties of fitness, merchantability, non-infringement, or any implied warranties arising out of a course of performance, dealing, trade usage, or fitness for a particular purpose. B. No Representations Regarding Information Strikingly makes no representation of any of the information found on Strikingly’s site. The materials on Strikingly’s site and for the affiliated sites are provided “as is” without any express or implied warranty of any kind. Strikingly does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the information, text, graphics, links, or other items contained on the Strikingly Sites. Any of the information offered on a Strikingly Site may change at any time without notice. C. No Liability for Damage Should the materials or services provided prove defective and/or cause any damage to equipment or any loss or inconvenience to the Affiliate or anyone claiming through the Affiliate, the Affiliate assumes the entire cost and responsibility for them. D. No Indemnify Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other agreement to the contrary, Strikingly shall have no obligation to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless the Affiliate in connection with any matter related to or arising out of the subject matter of this Agreement. E. No Exclusive Dealing This Agreement does not obligate Strikingly or any of its related parties to deal exclusively with Affiliate or any of its related parties. Strikingly maintains the right to compete with the Affiliate and any of the Affiliate’s related parties to the extent permissible under applicable law. F. No Employment Relationship The affiliate is an independent contractor and not an employee of Strikingly. Affiliates agree to indemnify and hold harmless Strikingly from any liability that may result from Affiliate claiming to be or acting as if Affiliate is anything other than an independent contractor of Strikingly. X. Strikingly’s Limitations of Liability Under no circumstances shall Strikingly, its subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, or suppliers be held liable for any direct or indirect damages and/or losses, to the Affiliate, user, and/or other third parties that may arise due to (i) “downtime” and/or availability of Strikingly site or the program, and any losses of any kind that may result due to downtime in the program and/or any other third party’s down time; (ii) any termination of this agreement; (iii) any investments, actual or planned, by the affiliate in connection with its participation in the affiliates program. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, Strikingly, its subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, or suppliers will not be liable to Affiliate with respect to any subject matter of this agreement under any contract, negligence, tort, strict liability, or other legal or equitable theory for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages (including, without limitation, loss of goodwill or actual or anticipated revenue, profits or lost business), even if Strikingly, its subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees or suppliers have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising in connection with this agreement and the program will not exceed the total fees paid or payable to the Affiliate under this agreement in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date on which the event giving rise to the most recent claim of liability occurred. XI. Modification of this Agreement Strikingly may modify any of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, at any time and in its sole discretion by providing Affiliate fourteen (14) days prior notice of such modification. Notice of any change by Email, to Affiliate’s address as provided to Strikingly, or the posting on a Strikingly Site of a change notice or a new agreement, is considered sufficient notice to Affiliate of a modification to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Modifications may include but are not limited to, changes in the scope of available Referral Fees, payment procedures and schedules, and Affiliation Program rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Referral Fees Plan may be altered, modified, or changed by Strikingly, from time to time, in its sole and absolute discretion, provided that Strikingly will notify Affiliate of such change of the Referral Fees Plan. Referral Fees earned prior to such change will be paid according to the conditions in effect prior to such changes. Referral Fees earned after such change is in effect will be paid according to the new conditions of the amended Referral Fees Plan’s effective date at which the payment has been made. If any modification is unacceptable to Affiliate, Affiliate’s sole recourse shall be to terminate this Agreement. Affiliate’s continued participation in the Program following the posting of a change notice or a new agreement on a Strikingly Site will constitute binding acceptance of such change. XII. Termination of this Agreement This Agreement will continue in effect until (i) it is terminated by notice of either of the parties, (ii) Affiliate breaches this agreement, (iii) the term of this agreement expires, or (iv) this Agreement is terminated by an act of law or government body. Upon the termination of the Affiliation Term for any reason, the Affiliate shall promptly remove all Affiliate Links, Ads, and other Program-related content from Affiliate Site or any other communication means used by the Affiliate. Affiliate will immediately cease use of, and remove from Affiliate Site, all links to Strikingly Site, all of Strikingly Marks, and all other materials provided by or on behalf of Strikingly to the Affiliate pursuant hereto or in connection with the Program. Any terms or provisions of this Agreement that, by their express terms do, or by their nature should survive termination of the Affiliation Term, shall continue to be in force despite the termination of the Affiliation Term. A. Termination at Will The term of the Affiliate’s participation in the Program shall commence upon Strikingly’s acceptance of the Affiliate Application and shall end upon the provision of a termination notice by either party in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Either party may terminate this Agreement as for its own participation in the Program at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party ten (10) days prior written notice of termination. Termination of the Agreement will result in the deactivation or deletion of the Affiliate’s account or its access to the Affiliate account in the Strikingly Site, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all potential or to-be-paid Referral Fees in the Affiliate’s account. For the avoidance of doubt, Strikingly will not pay Referral Fees to any Affiliate after that Affiliate’s termination, even if that Affiliate otherwise accrued Referral Fees that were owed and unpaid. Such fees will be canceled upon termination of this Agreement. Except as stated otherwise, upon the termination of this Agreement, the Affiliate will be entitled to receive Referral Fees for Premium Subscribers accrued during the Affiliation Term. B. Termination for Cause While any breach by Affiliate of this agreement is grounds for Strikingly to terminate this Agreement immediately, four (4) circumstances, in particular, may arise that will result in Strikingly immediately terminating this Affiliate Agreement with You. In the event of a material breach of this Agreement by Affiliate, Strikingly may, at its sole and absolute discretion, terminate the Affiliation Term immediately, without prior notification, and the Affiliate will not be entitled to receive any unpaid Referral Fees, regardless of whether or not such fees accrued prior to such termination. 1. Fraud If an Affiliate attempts any of the methods forbidden in this Agreement or any other methods that could reasonably be construed as fraud, Strikingly will terminate this Affiliate Agreement with regard to the Affiliate who is committing any type of fraud or scam. 2. Disputes If an Affiliate files an unreasonable number of disputes with Strikingly, or if new users referred to Strikingly by an Affiliate tend to file disputes at an unusually high rate, Strikingly will terminate this Affiliate Agreement with regard to the Affiliate who is causing or related to such disputes. 3. Refunds If users referred to by an Affiliate demand refunds or made fraudulent purchases at an unusually high rate, Strikingly will terminate this Affiliate Agreement with regard to the Affiliate who referred such users. 4. SPAM The Company has a zero-tolerance policy against Spam. Any Affiliate who sends Spam will be terminated immediately. XIII. Dispute Resolution Affiliate acknowledges and agrees that any disputes between Affiliate and Company shall first be resolved through internal negotiations. The Affiliate must first contact the company to seek a mutually agreeable resolution to any concerns. If that does not result in the Affiliate’s satisfaction, the Affiliate shall enter into mediation regarding the dispute. If mediation does not result in an amicable resolution, then the Affiliate must then bring the claim to arbitration, as more fully set forth below. Affiliate has waived any and all rights to file a lawsuit in a court with regard to any matters set forth in this Affiliate Agreement. A. Negotiation Strikingly aims to ensure that Affiliates are satisfied with their relationship with Strikingly, and we hope to resolve any concerns quickly and amicably. If Affiliate has any concerns about this Agreement, the Affiliate should first email affiliates@strikingly.com. The company tries to respond to concerns as promptly as practicable and to resolve them through direct discussions. B. Mediation If a dispute arises from or relates to this contract or the breach thereof, and if the dispute cannot be settled through direct discussions, Affiliates agrees to endeavor first to settle the dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association (“ AAA ”) under its Commercial Mediation Procedures before resorting to arbitration. C. Arbitration Procedures Affiliate further agrees that any unresolved controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the AAA in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of arbitration shall be San Francisco, California. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of California. If the dispute is less than $5,000 there shall be no discovery other than the exchange of documents. If the dispute is over $5,000, discovery shall consist of no more than 3 depositions of 3 hours or less. In making determinations regarding the scope of the exchange of electronic information, the arbitrator(s) and the parties agree to be guided by The Sedona Principles, Third Edition: Best Practices, Recommendations & Principles for Addressing Electronic Document Production. The arbitration will be based on the submission of documents and there shall be no in-person or oral hearing. The award shall be made within 3 months of the filing of the notice of intention to arbitrate (demand), and the arbitrator(s) shall agree to comply with this schedule before accepting an appointment. However, this time limit may be extended by the arbitrator for good cause shown, or by mutual agreement of the parties. The arbitrators will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party's actual damages, except as may be required by statute. The arbitrator(s) shall not award consequential damages in any arbitration initiated under this section. D. Confidentiality of Arbitration Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties. E. Costs of Arbitration Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses and an equal share of the arbitrators' and administrative fees of arbitration. The parties agree that failure or refusal of a party to pay its required share of the deposits for arbitrator compensation or administrative charges shall constitute a waiver by that party to present evidence or cross-examine witnesses. In such event, the other party shall be required to present evidence and legal argument as the arbitrator(s) may require for the making of an award. Such waiver shall not allow for a default judgment against the non-paying party in the absence of evidence presented as provided above. F. No Right to Jury Trial You hereby waive any rights to trial by jury in any action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions relating to its subject matter. G. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief You agree that You may bring claims against Strikingly only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative, or private attorney general action or proceeding. Unless both You and Strikingly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person's or party's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, class, or private attorney general action or proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other users. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this Section’s limitations as to a particular claim or a particular request for a remedy (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or that remedy request (and only that claim or that remedy request) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to Your and Strikingly’s right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated. XIV. Confidentiality Strikingly may disclose to Affiliate certain information as a result of Affiliate’s participation in the Program, which information we consider to be confidential. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “ Confidential Information ” shall include, but not be limited to (i) any modifications to the terms and provisions of the Program made specifically for the Affiliate or Affiliate Site and not generally available to other affiliates of the Program; (ii) price guidelines, future service releases, trade secrets, know-how, inventions, processes, programs, schematics, data, pricing, and discount schedules, customer lists, financial information, and sales and marketing plans relating to Strikingly or Strikingly’s services. Confidential Information shall also include any information that Strikingly designates as confidential during the term of this Agreement. Confidential Information shall not include information which is: (a) previously known to the other party without an obligation of confidence or without breach of this Agreement; (b) which is publicly disclosed (other than by the Affiliate) either prior or subsequent to the Affiliate’s receipt of such information; or (c) required to be disclosed by the other party by law or by the order of a court or similar judicial or administrative body. Affiliate shall at all times, both during the Term and at all times thereafter, keep and hold such Confidential Information in the strictest confidence, and shall not use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than as may be reasonably necessary for the performance of its duties pursuant to this Agreement, without Strikingly’s prior written consent. XV. Miscellaneous Provisions The headings herein are inserted as a matter of convenience only and do not define, limit, or describe the scope of this Agreement or the intent of the provisions hereof. A. No Waiver The failure of each of the parties to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the conditions and terms of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Strikingly’s failure to enforce Affiliate’s strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of Strikingly’s right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement. B. Entire Agreement This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties regarding the specific subject matter covered herein. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior written or verbal contracts or understandings between the parties hereto and neither party shall be bound by any statements or representations made by either party not embodied in this Agreement.

It is the Affiliate’s responsibility to be aware of all such regulations, statutes, and laws. E. Choice of Law If any dispute arises in connection with the performance of this Agreement and cannot be amicably resolved, such dispute shall be solely and finally governed by and be construed according to the laws of the state of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereto.

However, each plan type has different limits on the number of bookable events allowed: Free plan - Limited to 1 event Limited plan - Up to 4 events Pro plan - Up to 10 events VIP plan - Up to 100 events What type of businesses can use the Bookings Section? We currently support 1-on-1 and 1-on-Multiple attendees booking modes.

If you are in a service or industry that you don't see here, send us a message via support, and we'll keep you updated in the future! How do I add the booking section to my site? Go to your site editor and click \"Add New Section\" in the left panel. Go to \"Commerce\" and select the \"Booking\" section from the list. Here's what it looks like. How do I set up your event type? There are two ways to go to the Booking settings: Click on the booking section you've added. Go to your Settings > Bookings > Event Type. Once you are there, click on the \"Add Event Type\" button to get started. Adding an event type is similar to adding products in the store section. You can set the image, name, and description, and copy the item URL as an individual page. Event types have some unique fields: Location Required field. Your attendees will see this in the email and event info. This can be a physical location like an address, or just \"online.\" Duration You can select 15 minutes / 30 minutes / 45 minutes / 1 hour / 1.5 hours / 2 hours / 3 hours / 4 hours to determine how long each booking will be. This is the duration of an individual booking, for example, a single customer's salon appointment. For example in the attendee view - the change of duration will impact on the live site: If you set 30 minutes , the time slots start from your weekly hours and show 10:00am-10:30am, 10:30am-11:00am, 11:00am-11:30am… If you set 1 hour , show 10:00am-11:00am, 11:00am-12:00an, 12:00am-1:00pm… If you set 4 hours , show 10:00am-2:00pm, 2:00pm-6:00pm, 6:00pm-10:00pm… Availability This setting determines when bookings are available. You can set Recurring Weekly Hours and Fixed Date Overrides. This is designed for recurring routines and special day schedules (e.g. holidays). Fixed Date Overrides will override the time of Recurring Weekly Hours if they overlap. For example, if you've set a recurring availability for MON 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM, and you've set an override on Jan 24, 2022 (Monday) as \"Not Available\", your attendee will not be able to book for Jan 24, 2022. You also have the option to adjust the time zone within the availability settings. Simply click on the default time zone and select your preferred one. Editing an existing event Once an event is created, only the following fields can be edited: Name, Image, Description, Location, Availability, and Categories. However, the capacity, timezone, and duration cannot be changed, and you’ll need to create a new event if you wish to modify them. Attendee experience in the live site After you've set up an event type (with duration and availability), your site visitors will be able to make bookings.

We enforce these guidelines in order to ensure high email deliverability and to ensure your emails are not marked as spam in your recipients’ inboxes! Note: These requirements apply to all emails you send from Strikingly, including newsletters, individual audience emails, and automatic email notifications sent to your audience . Requirements: We automatically add an unsubscribe link in the footer of every email from Strikingly --- you don’t have to do anything. If a recipient unsubscribes, they will no longer receive the relevant email. (Emails without an unsubscribe link are more likely to be marked as spam.) We add a permission reminder in the footer of every email. This reminds recipients why they’re receiving this email and which website this email is coming from, in case they mistakenly believe your email is spam. You can edit the permission reminder to fit your own situation. If you manually add email recipients (contacts that did not fill out a form on your website), make sure you do not email those users unless you’ve received the recipients' consent. Every email must include a valid physical address to reach you. Please add your physical address in Email Notifications in the site editor, and we'll insert this address into all the emails you send. Don't use illegal or suspicious words in your email. Strikingly has a filter to detect spam content and your emails may be blocked if they trigger it. In the Email Notification settings, you may set an email address in the “From Email” field to specify the address shown in your recipients’ inbox. This email address must be a real one that you own. (When you set a new “From Email,” you will be asked to verify your ownership with a code.) Please observe any additional anti-spam laws that apply to you and your jurisdiction. International Requirements By Country Email regulations vary by country, so you may be subject to additional regulations depending on both the location of your business and your contacts.

Can I import products from another Strikingly site? Yes! You can export products from site A, and re-import CSV into site B. 2. Can I export products from Simple Store? Yes. You can follow this guide: Export Products to CSV. 3. What currency will be used when I set a product price in the CSV file? You should not input the currency symbol in the CSV file. We will use whatever currency you have set in Settings - Accept Payments. 4. How do I upload product images via CSV? You may upload product images using a publicly-accessible URL, like https://user-images.strikinglycdn.com/res/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_1000,w_500,f_auto,q_auto/1339460/815163_385649.jpeg If your images are already on the Internet, you can grab the URL simply by right-clicking the image and then selecting \"Copy image URL.\" If you're looking for somewhere to host your images, we recommend searching for some popular image hosting tools (e.g. imgur.com ) that can give you publicly-accessible image URLs.

    "text": "The Audience Plan\n\nThe Audience Plan is an add-on plan in Strikingly that supercharges your audience engagement! An Audience Plan allows you to: Add Live Chat to your site ( learn more ) Accept more Membership Registrations on your site, including Paid Subscription Memberships ( learn more ) Send more Newsletters & emails to your audience members ( learn more ) What is an Active Contact? Pricing for the Audience Plan works via a sliding scale, depending on how many active contacts you'd like in your account. Active contacts are the sum of: the number of Live Chats across your sites in the current calendar month the number of unique contacts that you send emails to (via newsletters and 1-on-1 messaging ) in a given calendar month the number of membership registrations across all your sites Notes: Active contacts do not include contact form submissions, email form submissions, and Simple Store customers. You can always have an unlimited number of those! When you're on an Audience Plan , active contacts do not count the messages you send. You can send as many messages as you want, but please be aware that spamming your audience too often will result in poor email deliverability and may hurt your site's reputation. Without an Audience Plan, Free, Limited, & Pro users can have up to 100 active contacts and send up to 100 messages, and VIP users can have up to 2000 active contacts. You can see your current active contacts at the bottom of the Audience tab of your dashboard . The contacts are counted per account and not per site. How Do I Upgrade? This is your first time upgrading to an audience plan? Strikingly gives you a 7-day trial period. Click here to check our plans!

    "text": "Set Taxes as Included In Product Price\n\nNote: When selling products online, please consult with a tax lawyer and/or accountant to make sure your business adheres to local regulations and collects the required taxes. In Simple Store, how do I set taxes as \"Tax Included\"? In some jurisdictions, you may need to set a tax rate but need to indicate that the tax is already included in the listed price of an item. In this case, the tax rate will not be added to the total price that the customer must pay. Instead, it is simply indicated as \"included\" in the price. You can set this using the Tax Calculation setting. By default, this is set to \"Taxes are added,\" which means any tax rate you set will be added to the order price before payment. Instead, you can set it to \"Taxes are included,\" which means any tax rate you set will not be added to the order price. Instead, the tax rate will merely be indicated as \"tax included.\" Can I set different tax rates for different regions? Yes, if you select \"US State\" tax mode or \"European VAT\" tax mode, you can set a different tax rate for certain regions. How is the tax calculated based on these settings? For example, assume a product has a price of €10.00, with no shipping fee. Assume the tax rate for Germany is 19%, and the tax rate for Switzerland is 7.7%. Now let's see what happens when a customer goes through checkout for this one item: If tax calculation is set to Tax Added : A customer shipping to Germany will pay a total of €11.90 . The 19% tax ( € 1.90) is added to the order price. A customer shipping to Switzerland will pay a total of €10.77 . The 7.7% tax ( € 0.77) is added to the order price. If tax calculation is set to Tax Included : A customer shipping to Germany will pay a total of €10.00 . This price will be automatically calculated as €8.40 for the product and €1.60 for the tax (since €1.60 is 19% of €8.40.) A customer shipping to Switzerland will pay a total of €10.00 . This price will be automatically calculated as €9.29 for the product and €0.71 for the tax (since €0.71 is 7.7% of €9.29.) In both cases, the customer will see this clearly indicated at checkout. When I export my orders, will I see how much tax is included? Yes, when you export your orders as CSV (useful for external processing), there is a column to indicate if the tax value is \"Tax Included\" or not. There is a \"Tax\" column, which shows the tax value, and a \"Tax Included\" column, which is either TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE, that means the tax value was included in the price. For more information about tax settings, please see the main article on tax settings . For questions drop us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.",

    "text": "Paid Subscription Membership\n\nStart a subscription business and get paid every month! By creating a Paid Subscription Membership on your site, your visitors will be able to pay a recurring subscription to become members. You can then give paid members special access to paid-only content. Paid Membership is perfect for selling recurring content or a subscription product. You can create multiple tiers of membership at different prices, and even set discounts for quarterly or yearly plans. Note: This feature is only available for Pro Plan & up. On a Pro plan, you can create one paid membership tier. On a VIP plan, you can create five membership tiers. Contents How to Sell Subscription Memberships Setting Up Members-Only Pages View Member Information in Audience List Test Tier What Your Customer Sees Difference between Registration Methods FAQ 1. Can I create coupons for a Paid Subscription Membership? 2. Can I set specific products in my Simple Store to have recurring payments? 3. How does monthly payment recur if the initial payment starts on the 31st of a month? 4. Can I edit the amount of each existing pricing? Difference between PRO and VIP PRO VIP Supports 1 Membership Tier Supports Up To 5 Membership Tiers How to Sell Subscription Memberships Before setting up Paid Membership , we recommend you read through Activate the Membership first. 1. Connect your Stripe account We currently only support Stripe as the payment gateway for Paid Subscriptions. Connect your Stripe account in Settings > Accept Payment first. Make sure your Stripe is \"Enabled\". See how to connect to Stripe here. 2. Select Registration Method & Set a price Then, in your Membership settings, set the Registration Method to Paid Subscription Membership and set a monthly price. Note: The price will automatically be billed to your members on a recurring basis until they cancel or you cancel the subscription, or until the payment fails. The price is billed every month, quarter, or year. Recurring payments are collected on the same day of the month. For example, if a monthly subscription is started on January 1, it will renew on February 1, March 1, etc. The price must be greater than or equal to US$0.50 in any currency. If the amount is less than US$0.50 equivalent, the payment will fail! Regardless of your selected currency, please make sure the price's USD equivalent is at least US$0.50. If you have Paid Subscription Memberships, you must keep your Stripe connection active. If you disconnect Stripe, all of your recurring subscriptions will be terminated immediately. 3. Add Multiple Membership Tiers (Available for VIP users) You can create a new tier by clicking the \"+ ADD TIER \" button. You can create up to 5 tiers on one site. Multiple membership tiers can be reordered by dragging & drop the burger icon on the left. This will change the order they will appear for your customer when they register. 4. Delete membership tier Delete a tier by clicking the ' Delete ' button on the bottom right of the edit tier popup if you don't want to sell this tier anymore. When you delete a membership tier with the \"Free Membership\" or \"Buy Product to Register\" registration method, it will be deleted immediately, and visitors will not be able to select this tier anymore upon registration. When you delete a membership tier with the \"Paid Subscription Membership\" tier: New visitors will not be able to select this tier anymore upon registration. For any existing members who are still actively paying for the subscription: Their membership will expire after their current billing period, and will no longer be renewed. This tier will become a \"legacy tier\" which holds any remaining expiring memberships. Once all memberships have expired, the legacy tier will also be deleted. You can click \" View legacy tiers \" to view these expiring tiers. Information about former members will still be kept in the Audience list, labeled as \" Former Member .\" 5. Manage Subscriptions in Strikingly Orders. If you have a store on your site, you can view all subscriptions in Orders > Subscriptions . Each subscription has a status: Active : The customer has paid successfully, and the subscription is ongoing. Canceled : The subscription was canceled by the site owner or members, this subscription will show Cancelled status. The customer is no longer billed, and they will no longer be able to access \"paid members only\" content. Payment Failed : A renewal payment has failed. The customer is no longer billed, and they will no longer be able to access \"paid members only\" content. As the site owner, you can manually cancel a subscription on the Subscription Detail page. Upon cancellation, this member will no longer have access to \"paid members only\" content, and will no longer be billed. In the Subscription History section, you can see the history of events relating to this subscription, including each payment time. Note: If you don’t plan to sell anything, no worries, you can still add a store section and hide it . This allows you to track your paid subscriptions from the Orders tab, while keeping the store section hidden from your visitors. Setting Up Members-Only Pages Give your customers access to exclusive online content by creating members-only pages. For more details, please see Add Membership to Your Website! 1. On your site editor, click Manage. 2. Click the gear icon of the page that you want to set as members-only. Members only : all free members, paid members, and members with cancelled subscriptions will see this page. Paid members only : the paid members with an active paid subscription will see this page. Specific tiers : only members of the selected tiers will see this page. Members who purchased a specific product : (if you already have a Simple Store on your site), Store customers who purchased a specific product will see this page. You can set up existing pages as members-only, or you can start with a new page. All sections will be available for you to add! View Member Information in Audience List In the Audience list, you can view all your members by clicking the \"Members\" tab or by applying a custom filter to view only selected membership tiers. When viewing the details for an Audience contact, in the left sidebar there are ways to edit a user's membership. You can delete membership for any member. When you do this, they will no longer be able to log in. If the membership is a paid membership, they will no longer be billed. You can also grant membership to an existing non-member user. When you do this, the user will receive an email with the login URL. You will be able to select which tier you want to grant. If you choose to grant a paid membership tier, this user will not be billed. You can use this to bypass the billing system but still grant specific memberships to specific users. (If you want to grant membership to a new user, you will need to Import contacts manually first.) Test Account When you activate a membership on your site, we automatically create a test account so you can see what your site looks like to a member. You can see the details from your Membership page settings > Log in URL. To test different membership tiers, you can select a tier for your test account. Then, when you log into your live site using this test account, you'll see your site as if you're a member of that tier. What Your Customer Sees View this example site: http://paidmembership.mystrikingly.com/ 1. Register & checkout When a visitor opens the registration URL, they will see a popup. If your site has multiple membership tiers, the visitor will be prompted to select a membership tier. The tiers will be listed in the same order that they were configured in your store's Membership settings. If the tier has many payment options (e.g. monthly, yearly), those will be shown as various payment options. Note: \"Buy Product to Register\" tiers will not be shown here, since the visitor must buy an item from the store to gain membership. Note: Even if your customers cancel the checkout or the initial payment failed, they will have a free membership. In this case, they can begin a subscription via the \"My Account\" menu on your live site. 2. View Subscription in My Account Your members are able to view their subscription details in the \" My Account \" menu after logging into your site. They can also cancel anytime. When the subscription is canceled, the customer's membership will revert to a free membership, and will no longer have access to the \"paid member only\" content. A free member will see other paid membership tiers and can subscribe to one from the tiers list. When the renewal payment failed, the subscription will become canceled and will expire immediately. Difference between Registration Methods Registration Method Customer Experience Free Membership Anyone can register, no payment is required. Paid Subscription Membership A member is required to subscribe & pay for the Paid Membership during the registration. Buy Product to Register Buy Any Product to Register Any customer who buys a product from your store will receive a membership via email. Buy Specific Product to Register Any customer who buys specific products from your store will receive a membership via email. For more details, we recommend you read these related tutorials: Add Membership to Your Website! Sell Your Online Courses with Membership FAQ 1. Can I create coupons for a Paid Subscription Membership? Currently, our coupons do not support Paid Subscription Membership. If you need this feature, please let us know via online support. 2. Can I set specific products in my Simple Store to have recurring payments? Unfortunately, no. Currently, our Paid Membership function is tied to our Membership function, and not to our Simple Store, since the recurring payment subscription model works differently than regular store products. 3. How does monthly payment recur if the initial payment starts on the 31st of a month? Example: A $10/month subscription begins on July 31. The customer will be billed as follows: July 31 = $10.00 August 31 = $10.00 October 1= $10.00 October 31= $10.00 4. Can I edit the amount of each existing pricing? No, you cannot directly edit the amount of each existing pricing. However, you can uncheck an existing pricing. If you uncheck it, existing members who belong to this pricing will continue to pay, but non-members won't see this pricing and won't be able to purchase it. If you decide to check the existing pricing again after unchecking it, there won't be any effect on existing members. But the pricing option will become visible to non-members, and they'll be able to purchase it. Please note, you need to keep at least one pricing option checked at all times. 5. Are there any transaction fees for paid membership s ubscription ? Yes, we use Stripe for recurring payment. The transaction fees for Stripe differ based on your location. Please refer to Stripe's website or contact their support for detailed fee information. Strikingly.com also charges additional fees for using payment gateways. You can find information about transaction fees on your pricing page . 6. Can I use Square for paid membership subscription? No, we currently only support Stripe for recurring payment processing.",

    "text": "Showcase Your Product\n\nHaving a display of products lets potential buyers decide or have a look at what they might buy. We have the \" Portfolio \" section that allows you to do that for your customers to let them see what you offer. There are a few things, though, that you'd have to keep in mind when showing your product line-up online: Show a detailed view of or images of your products. People buying on the internet can't really see what your products actually look like, so it's best to have photos with exceptional quality. Give it a premium \"feel\". You'd want people to get more interested in what you're selling. Since your customers can't check your products physically, it is good to have images that highlight the product itself. A clear image of your product against a white background usually does the trick! Setting up a product showcase should be easy. Let me show you how you can do it: In your site editor, click the \" Add new section \" button on the left panel. Scroll down and pick the \" Creative Portfolio \" or \" Product Catalog \" section. Click \"Add Product\" in the section. Start adding your products like how you would in a regular \"Simple Store\" section. Click the \" Add New Item \" button. You can add up to 10 images on each product, and a product description of up to 1200 characters. The images will be shown as below. Notice that there are thumbnails, which you can click if you'd like to view and enlarge the other images on the product page. There are also options for you to utilize, such as Show Price - Display your product pricing to make it easier for your customers in making a buying decision. Show Button - Link your product to a product review page. Since online buyers can't go to a physical store to inspect the product quality, most of them rely on other buyers' feedback. Categories - On a Pro/VIP account, you can use \"Categories\" to organize your product showcase if you are selling different products. For instance, you sell a lot of apparel. You can create categories like Shirts, Jeans, Shorts, Dresses, etc. Here's how you can set up categories. Show Detailed Description - Aside from the product description page, you can add more details here about your product, such as ingredients, directions for use, etc. The Detailed Description also allows up to ten more images. Use custom product URL - On Pro/VIP, you can use a link that's specific to each product you're showcasing, which makes it easier for your potential buyers to remember. When you're done adding all info on your product page, hit \"Save\". This will automatically update the Product Showcase on your live site if previously published. Adding Categories to Product Showcase To add and manage product categories, go to your Creative Portfolio section, then click \" Categories \". Click the \" Add new category \" button to create. You can also rename, delete, or reorder categories in this panel. Adding Products to Categories After setting up your categories, go back to your product manager to add products to the categories. Pick one product to edit and click the \"Select a category\" drop-down menu to add a category tag. You can add up to five category tags for each product. Click \"Save\" when you're done. Once you've added and saved the category tags for each one of your products, the Creative Portfolio section should show all categories on a menu at the top.

    "text": "Store Coupons for Returning Customers / Members-Only Coupons\n\nA common sales technique is to create coupons that are only available for customers who have already purchased something from your store. This is a great way to convert your existing customers into repeat buyers. Using Strikingly's powerful Membership feature and Simple Store coupons , you can launch your own campaign to drive your customers back to your online store! Let's get started: Set up your online store Adding a store to your site is easy! If you haven't set up your store yet, follow the steps in this article . Create your discount coupons Once you're done setting up your store, start creating coupons ! These coupons will be distributed to your members via your secure members-only page (we'll deal with that later). You can offer seasonal discounts, or permanent discount codes for your members to encourage them to buy again from your store. And here are a few useful tips: Keep the coupon codes short and easy to remember. Make it relevant. If it's New Year, offer a coupon code like START2020 or NEWYEAR20. For your Valentine's campaign, use LOVEMYSELF or 14HUGS. To create a sense of urgency for your customers, create a limited-time coupon by setting an expiration date. Once your store and coupon setup is done, you can now proceed to activate your site's membership! Activate your site's membership feature This step is important to secure your coupon codes and make sure that only repeat customers can have access. In this setting, anyone who purchases from your store automatically becomes a member. 1. Exit your store manager. From the left panel, click Settings > Membership , or click Audience > Membership. 2. Under Registration Method , choose \" Grant Membership to Store Customers \" and click \" Next \". This means that all customers who buy a product will automatically receive a login account and password. 3. Personalize the email notification that your customers receive when they become members. Everyone loves a personalized message! Go to Settings > Membership > Email Notifications. Click \"Edit\" under \"Notifications sent to member\". We'd recommend that you keep it short and sweet to not distract your customers from the value that you are offering--discounts on the next purchase. Create your member's page Your member's page will house all coupon codes that you will distribute to your loyal members. This page is secured with individual usernames and passwords. You need to activate multi-pages to set up a members-only page, so let's start with that step! 1. From your site editor, click Settings > Multiple Pages . Activate the multiple pages feature by clicking the green \" Activate Multiple Pages \" button. 2. Once activated, exit the settings panel and click \"Manage\" from the left panel. 3. Click the green \" Add New Page \" button. Type the name of your new page. In this example, we used \"Coupons\" (so it's easy). 4. Click the gear icon beside your new member's page, and set it as \"members only\". 5. On the next window, you can choose \"Only registered members who purchased a specific product\" and select the product. You can also select other options depending on who the coupon is for. 6. When you're done, click \"Back to Site Design\" and start adding sections and design your own coupon page. Be creative! Test out your new website! When you're done setting up content for your members-only page, go back to Settings > Membership. Copy and paste the test logins and save them in your notepad. Hit \"Publish\" and you're live! You can now use the test logins to check your buyer flow. Try it out! Here's a sample site: http://ilovepastry.mystrikingly.com/ (Don't worry, you won't get charged if you make purchases!) ___________________ Did you know?

    "text": "Sell Your Online Courses with Membership\n\nYou can sell online courses using Strikingly's powerful Membership feature , which is available for Pro and VIP users. The Membership feature allows you to restrict page access to only those members who purchased certain membership tiers or items from your site's store. This means you can sell a course using Strikingly's Simple Store, then create a page that is only visible to customers who bought that specific course. Note: There are two ways to create a membership course: a one-time payment, or a recurring payment. This walkthrough guides you on how to set up a one-time payment membership . For a recurring payment membership, please see this guide . The Final Result: Check out this sample site: http://sellmycourses.mystrikingly.com/ This site offers 3 courses: 1. Social Media Marketing 2. Effective SEO Techniques 2019 3. Bundle Promo If you purchase Social Media Marketing, your access is limited to that course only. The same is true for Effective SEO Techniques. However, if you purchase the Bundle Promo, you will both have access to the Social Media Marketing Course page and the Effective SEO Techniques page. Test out how it works by logging in to the site! Access limited to Effective SEO Techniques course: Email: weare@happinessofficers.com Initial Password: zJbp4cm3gLFSYWj8 Bundle Promo Access: Email: support@strikingly.com Initial Password: I4fCaX5T7ZzIGR7N You can do the same! Follow these steps: Set Up Your Store You can use an existing site or create a new one. 1. On your site editor, add a new section and select \" Simple Store \" from the section list. 2. Set up your courses by adding products. Each product can correspond to one course. You can select the \" Service\" product type. Activate the membership feature When you're done setting up products, you are now ready to activate the membership feature! To do that, go to your Site Editor > Audience > Membership. Under Registration Method , choose \" Grant Membership to Store Customers \" and click \"Next\". Then, select the online courses that you set up earlier. After setting up your membership, you can now proceed to set up your members page where you can add your content for each course. Create your members page You should have multiple pages activated before you can set up your member-specific page. 1. If you haven't activated multi-pages yet, click \" Activate Multiple Pages \" from Settings > Multiple Pages. 2. If you have activated that on your site already, click the \" Create a members-only page \" from the Membership settings page. 3. Set up your new member's page name. Type the name of your new page. This new page will house the content for your course. In this example, let's use \"Learn the Basics\" as the page name. 4. Click the gear icon beside your new members' page, and set it as \"members-only\". 5. On the next window, select \"Only registered members who purchased a specific product.\" Tie it to the course (product) that you want. With this setting, only users who purchased \"Online Course #1\", will have access to the page \"Learn the Basics\" that you set up. You can set up different members' pages and tie them to different courses! Pro Tip: You can set up bundled courses and get anyone who purchases them access to two or more different members-only pages! 1. Set up a bundle course on your store. 2. Tie course (product) to member pages it should have access to (bundled courses). What this setting means is that anyone who purchases the Spring Bundle Promo! and Online Course #1 will have access to the \"Learn the Basics\" page. You don't have to set up a different members page for the \"Spring Bundle Promo\" product because you are offering two existing content into one course (or product). 3. Add your content. The new member page that you created is empty. You can add videos, text, downloadable files, and more! Notes: If you're going to add YouTube videos, make sure that these videos are set to \"Unlisted\". This way, only people who have the link will have access to your site and it will not be searchable on YouTube. All files (PDF, documents, sheets, etc) that you upload on your members-only page will be secured. If anyone tries to access it via a direct link, it will not be accessible. Test out your new website! When you activate a membership on your site, we automatically create a test account so you can see what your site looks like to a member. To test different membership tiers, you can select a tier for your test account. Then, when you log into your live site using this test account, you'll see your site as if you're a member of that tier. __________________ Did you know?

    "text": "Add Shipping Fee per Item Weight\n\nA heavy product and a light product might not have the same shipping fee. Now in your product editor, you can specify a weight for each product (in kg or lb). Then head to your shipping settings and specify a rule to calculate a shipping fee based on an order's total weight. You can even set different rules for different shipping regions. During checkout, our system will automatically compute the shipping cost and add it to the total price. Setting Up Product Weight Go to your site editor > Settings > Store > Products. If you don't have a product yet, click \"Add New Product\". Add in your images, product description, and specify the weight of your product. If you have existing products, click \"Edit Product\". You should find the item weight under \"Shipping\". Make sure to tick the box beside \"Shipping info required from your customers?\" so the item weight appears! If your product has variations, you can also use a different weight for each variation. Click \"Save\" when you're done. Once you add weight to your products, set up your shipping fee. Setting Up Shipping Fee per Weight Go to your editor > Settings > Store > Shipping > Add Shipping Option. Under \"Shipping Rules\", click the dropdown and select \"By Order Weight\". On the next dropdown, you can choose between kilograms (kg) or pounds (lb) for your weight system. There are two shipping fee options: A. Base cost + Per kg cost. This is the default option. You add base shipping cost, and fees for each additional kg/lb. Base cost - minimum shipping price Per kg/lb cost - shipping cost on top of the base cost per additional kg/lb B. By Weight Range. You can also choose to add weight ranges and a price for each range. To do that, follow these steps: Click the \"Edit weight ranges\" link in blue. Set your weight range and hit “Save” when you’re done. Add your shipping fee for each weight range that you created. Click the green \"Update\" button when you're done! Please note that: You can add up to 5 weight ranges only. The weight range accepts up to 2 decimal points. If you input more than two decimal numbers, it will be rounded off. Negative numbers are not accepted. The succeeding weight range will be 0.01 kg/lb higher than your previous range. Your shipping fee will be automatically computed on checkout and added to the total price. Applying Shipping Fee per Region You can set different shipping fees for different regions. To add more regions, click the grey “Add Region” button, select the region where you want to apply your next weight ranges, and follow the steps above (Setting Up Shipping Fee per Weight). You can add up to 20 regions. But if you want a one shipping fee for overseas shipping, you can select \"The World/Rest of the World (if other regions are selected)\". Shipping Fee Calculations A. Using Base Cost and Per kb/lb Cost The formula used in calculating the shipping fee would be: base cost + (per kg cost x order weight) For example: If your order weighs 0.5kg, then the shipping fee will be computed as: $10.00 + ($5.00 x 0.5 kg) = $12.50 (shipping fee) However, if your order weighs 2.75 kg, then the shipping fee will be computed as $10.00 + ($5.00 x 2.75 kg) = $23.75 (shipping fee) If your customers buy 3 products with a total weight of 3.17 kg, it will be computed as follows: $10.00 + ($5.00 x 3.17 kg) = $25.85 (shipping fee) B. Shipping Fee Using Weight Range When weight ranges are set, the shipping fee will be based on the price that you set per range. For example: If your order weighs 1 kg and you're shipping it to the United States, the shipping fee will be $5.00. On the other hand, if your order weighs 2.25 kg and you're shipping to Canada, the cost will be $11.00. But if your customers buy 2 products with a total weight of 12 kg, here's how the shipping fee will be computed: (if shipping to the United States) $7.00 + ((12 kg - 4.00 kg) x $1.00) = $15.00 (if shipping to Canada) $12.00 + ((12 kg - 4.00 kg) x $1.00 = $20.00 That's it!

    "text": "Add Strikingly Live Chat to Your Site!\n\nLive Chat is a fantastic way to get leads on your site and to make sure your audience stays engaged. A human touch goes a long way to building trust in your business. You can now add a Live Chat widget directly to your site. Here's what it looks like: Watch our quick video tutorial here: Adding Live Chat Note: Live chat functionality is available for users with a Limited or Pro plan, provided they also have an Audience plan (An Audience Plan is an add-on plan that you can add on top of any Pro or Limited plan. It lets you adjust the audience size that's appropriate for your business. To learn more about the Audience Plan and how it powers the Membership feature, click here) . On the VIP plan, the Live Chat function comes with the plan. Once your account can activate Live Chat, you can enable it in your site editor through Settings > Live Chat > Activate Live Chat: Tip: Use your first name and a beautiful headshot of your face to make your visitors much more likely to chat with you. Visitors want to see that a real person is behind your site! Enabling Desktop Notifications We recommend enabling notifications in your browser to get notified if a visitor reaches out to you in Live Chat. If you're using Chrome or Firefox, you will receive notifications as long as your browser is open (or running in the background) , even if you don't have Strikingly open in a tab. If you accidentally disabled notifications and would like to re-enable them, read this guide for Chrome or this guide for Firefox . Make sure you allow notifications on strikingly.com! Enabling Email Notifications We recommend enabling email notifications in your Strikingly account so you can get notified if a new visitor reaches out to you in Live Chat. Just tap on the link in Email to reply to him! Note: the email notification will be sent to site owner, admin and agent. Editor and blogger will not receive email notification for New Live Chats. Make sure you are in the right role to receive it! The email notification for New Live Chats is turned on by default. You can modify the setting in My Account > Email Settings > New Live Chat: Responding to Visitors You can see incoming Live Chat messages by going to the Audience tab > Live Chat . Click on a contact to respond to those visitors. The desktop notification is a shortcut to enter the chat screen, even if you don't have the Strikingly dashboard open in a browser tab. See the above sections on how to set up desktop notifications. You can also respond to visitors through the Strikingly App on iOS or Android. You can receive a mobile notification whenever someone messages you on your site, and you can immediately tap on the notification to start chatting with the visitor through our phone app. Here's what the Strikingly app looks like when you're replying: Setting Up Email Forms You can choose whether to prompt your site visitors to enter their email before they start chatting with you. Requiring users to enter their email addresses before chatting might reduce conversion to live chat a bit, but it ensures that you can always reach back out to those visitors via email, even if they leave your site. The best part about Live Chat is that all visitors who enter the system are automatically added to your contact list. Even if you're offline, you can collect email addresses and messages and respond to the visitor at your convenience. Or, you can export these email addresses and use your own mailing list. Inviting Live Chat Collaborators You can also invite other members of your team as collaborators to help you respond to live chats! If you're on a VIP or Audience plan, visit the Collaborators Manager in Settings > Team > Add Teammate. Here, you can invite your colleagues as collaborators using their email addresses. Assign them an \"Agent\" role to only give them access to your site's Audience page and Live chat. After accepting the invitation, this collaborator will be able to log into Strikingly using their own email address. When they log into Strikingly, they will see your site in their dashboard's site list. There, they can click the \" Live Chat \" button to see & respond to all live chats for this site. Live Chat collaborators will also receive notifications for new live chat messages.

This way, everyone can enjoy your services, access data from your website, or enjoy your work. To improve your site's accessibility, here are a few tips: 1. Choose the right template. We've created strikingly beautiful templates that are accessible and fit your needs. You can choose your template from our Discover Page . 2. Add alt-text to your images. Visually impaired people might use assistive software to browse through your website. You can add your image descriptions via alt-text to help this software \"read\" them. | Pro Tip! JAWS , a popular screen reader, limits image descriptions at 125 characters. Keep it short and simple! 3. Use clear and easy-to-read fonts. Fonts play a critical part in your overall website design. We have several fonts available for you to choose from. While some fonts are more legible than others, pick one that doesn't compromise your style. | Pro Tip! Use text blocks to create content, instead of adding text to your images. 4. Take advantage of header tags. Your site's headings will help visitors with screen readers easily navigate your content and find the information that they need. 5. Use a color contrast ratio of 4.5:1. This should help visually impaired visitors distinguish, say, foreground and background colors on your website. You can also use third-party applications like Color Oracle to simulate how people with visual impairments view your website. Please note that this is a third-party program that is beyond our support. 6. Add captions to your videos. Add synchronized captions to your videos as an auxiliary aid to help increase your site's accessibility. Check out how to do that on YouTube here and on Vimeo here . Please note: Strikingly does not guarantee that using our website service will guarantee or ensure your website's compliance with all accessibility laws and other worldwide regulations.

You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Strikingly, ICANN, the applicable registries, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, and contractors, from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including attorney's fees, arising out of or relating to Your registration and use of the domain name registered; Use of the domain name in violation of this Agreement; or Your violation of any third-party right, including Intellectual Property Rights.

If within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of such notice, You fail to provide evidence, which is reasonably satisfactory to Strikingly, that You have not breached its obligations under the Agreement, then Strikingly may delete the registration of the domain name.

Except for the express warranties in this Agreement, Strikingly does not make any other warranty of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

    "text": "Strikingly's GDPR Compliance Statement\n\nWhat is GDPR? The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new European privacy regulation that will replace the current EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC). The GDPR aims to strengthen the security and protection of personal data in the EU and harmonize EU data protection law. Why is GDPR important? The GDPR has the potential to impact any business that collects data in or from Europe. One of the key aspects of the GDPR is that it creates consistency across EU member states on how personal data can be processed, used, and exchanged securely. If you collect, change, transmit, erase, or otherwise use or store the personal data of EU citizens, you’ll need to comply with the GDPR. If you are a website owner and collect personal data via web forms, especially from people who live in the European Union, you'll need to make your website compliant with this regulation, come on May 25, 2018. It is also important that you update your site's Privacy Policy to cover all personal information that is being collected through your site. What and who? The GDPR applies to all organizations operating in the EU and processing “personal identifiable data” of EU residents. Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. e.g., dates of birth, names, physical addresses, email addresses, and so on. About Consent You need to have a legal basis, like consent, to process an EU citizen’s personal data. This consent must be verifiable. It requires a written record of when and how someone agreed to let you process their personal data. About Individual Rights The GDPR also outlines the rights of individuals around their personal data. EU citizens will have the right to ask for details about the way you use their personal data, and can ask you to do certain things with that data. People have the right to request their personal data be corrected, provided to them, prohibited for certain users, or removed completely. How Does Strikingly Protect Your Data and Comply with GDPR? Strikingly is dedicated to protecting your data and complying with GDPR policies when it becomes enforceable on May 25, 2018. Our team is working with users around the world to answer their questions and to help them prepare for using Strikingly’s Services when GDPR takes effect. Our team has reviewed Strikingly’s product features and practices to ensure we support GDPR compliance requirements. This document provides a description of our practices and policies. 1. User Information Strikingly contracts security consultants to ensure the security of our user information. They perform regular security audits and infiltration testing to maintain our ISO/PCI security certifications. Any issues that are reported to our security team or raised during security audits are resolved as soon as possible. Strikingly encrypts databases containing sensitive information, according to PCI standards, to add additional protection of personally identifiable information. Our encryption methods render this information unreadable without a cryptographic key. Strikingly has a multiple-layer security architecture to help protect against 0-day security issues. Strikingly's signup, login, and payment services are completed through a secure server. The information provided to Strikingly in the signup process is secured via HTTPS/ SSL communication. Strikingly uses cryptography hash functions to protect users’ information. User’s password is stored as a hash digest and, in the event of a security breach, their original password cannot be recovered from our servers. 2. Data Security Strikingly has documented and implemented internal mechanisms for limiting the processing of personal data to only certain specified uses relating to Strikingly’s products and services. Strikingly only discloses Service Data to third parties where disclosures are necessary to provide the services or as required to respond to lawful requests from public authorities. Strikingly uses multiple data centers to guarantee a secure and highly available service at scale. 3. Transparent Terms Strikingly makes Terms & Conditions , and Privacy Policy clear and transparent to our users. 4. Data Processing Strikingly publishes Data Processing Agreement (DPA) , to address how we process data on users' behalf. 5. Internal Protocol We continuously train employees on best security practices, including how to identify social engineering, phishing scams, and hackers. Employees on teams that have access to customer data (such as tech support and our engineers) undergo criminal history and credit background checks before employment. All employees sign a Privacy Safeguard Agreement outlining their responsibility in protecting customer data. When a Strikingly employee leaves the company, we follow a strict checklist to ensure that all of their server access permissions are revoked. 6. Data Access Rights Request to view data: Strikingly provides users the right to access their data, check what data we have collected, and choose their data to be forgotten. Request to delete data: Strikingly provides data subjects with the right to delete data if the continued processing is not justified. For example, users may need to delete their customers' and site visitors' personal data to comply with GDPR obligations. Users may also delete their accounts, which will permanently remove relevant data from our servers. What Third-Party Data Services Does Strikingly Use? As a website editor and hosting service, we collect data to better serve your needs and continuously improve our product. In the Strikingly dashboard and editor, we log user event data to Mixpanel. This data is anonymized and contains no Personally Identifiable Information (PII). On published Strikingly websites, we log data to Google Analytics and Keen.io to record site visit data. This data is anonymized and contains no Personally Identifiable Information (PII). To view more detailed information about the data we collect, please see our Privacy Policy . How Do I Make My Strikingly Websites Compliant? If your website is targeting users in the European Union, you should enable GDPR for your own sites. Visit the following link to learn how.

    "text": "Enable GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) Compliance for Your Websites on Strikingly\n\nWhat is GDPR? GDPR is a European privacy law approved by the European Commission in 2016 which is designed to unify and regulate EU residents’ control of their personal data. Its enforcement began on May 25, 2018. What does it mean for everyone? If you are a website owner and collect personal data via web forms especially from people who live in the European Union, you'll need to make your website compliant to this regulation. It is also important that you update your site's Privacy Policy to cover all personal information that are being collected through your site. How do I make my website GDPR Compliant? Making your website GDPR-compliant is easy with Strikingly. You can activate the GDPR Compliance option by following these steps: 1. In your site editor, navigate to Settings > Advanced > Legal . Note: To use the GDPR Compliance feature, you must first activate the \"Terms & Conditions\" and \"Privacy Policy\", and add the appropriate text. We do not provide terms and conditions, but you may find free, publicly available templates online. Please consult a lawyer to tailor these documents to your business, and to ensure full compliance with all appropriate regulations. 2. Check the \"General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance\" box.

Check the \" Show European Union Cookie Notification \" box, and click \"Save.\" That's it! After activating GDPR compliance, all Strikingly web forms on your website will have checkboxes for agreeing to your consent message. The Cookie Notification activates a small dialog on your live site, where the visitor can Accept or Reject cookies and tracking scripts: Note: If you've activated this Cookie Notification, the visitor may opt out of this tracking, so your pageview counts may not be complete! Note: Any request received from a new GDPR-compliant web form will show in the Form Responses screen if a visitor has consented to your website.

    "text": "Banner Image Slider\n\nFor PRO Users, the banner section is a swipeable and linkable image slider - perfect for promotional materials and heavily designed background images. Unlike the Text and Button Slider, you cannot place any text, image, or button components in the banner image slider. How to Use the Banner Imager Slider? Upload an image that is heavily designed as the background image of the slider. In our example, the image already has the text and call-to-action button included within the image itself. After uploading your image as the background, you can add a link to the slider to make the entire slider clickable. Frequently Asked Questions What are the recommended dimensions for the Banner Slider image? We recommend uploading an image that's 1600 pixels wide by 600 pixels - but the section height expands and collapses to the height of the image you upload. *Note: It's best to use the exact dimensions for all the images uploaded into the banner section. How many banner slides can I add? You can add up to 20 slides for each banner section. How will the banner slider look on mobile devices? The banner image will resize automatically to show the entire banner image - so it's best to upload images where the text isn't too small to optimize for mobile visitors. Can I make a site completely out of banner image sliders? Yes, you can, but we discourage this practice. Although the banner section gives you a lot of flexibility in how you can design a section, creating a site entirely of banner sections will be bad for your site's search engine ranking because search engines won't be able to find text on your site.

If so, and you’d like to use your Google AdSense ad code with your Strikingly site or blog, you can check the following instructions. What type of Ad Units can be used? Display Ad Unit - We recommend this type as our websites are responsive as well. By choosing this size and setting its size as responsive , ads will automatically fit the page/section, depending on the screen size of the device used to view the site. Auto Ads - Allows you to use a single set of code that would work for the entire site. How to Create a Display Ad Unit in Google AdSense Login to your Google AdSense account and click Ads > By ad unit > Display Ads . Name your ad. Any name will do. It could be anything you can think of that would let you easily tell where you put the code in. Leave \"Ad size\" set to \"Responsive\" so the ad would resize to auto-fit the screen of any device. Copy the code and paste it into a notepad. How to add the Ad unit code to a Strikingly site Go to your site editor and click “ Add new section ”. Pick the “ Embed & HTML ” section. Hover over the newly added section, click “ Edit ” and select “ HTML ” from the available apps. Paste the Google Adsense code you copied earlier into the box, then hit “ Save ”. Preview your site to see how it looks on PC. Note: The preview for tablet and mobile will not automatically resize the ad unit as technically, the site preview is still being viewed on a larger screen (laptop or PC). The ad unit will look cropped. To see the resized ad, publish the site and access it on a mobile device. The responsive ad unit would look like this on mobile: Publish your site when you’re done editing! How to place Ad units in blog posts: Go to your Blog Manager and edit any of your blog posts. Click “Add content” and select “HTML”. Hover your mouse pointer on the “App Store & HTML” element and click “Edit”. Choose HTML and paste your ad code in the HTML box. Click “Save\". Preview your blog post to see how the ad will look on the published blog. Auto Ads (formerly Page-level Ads) Auto ads are ad formats that let you add a single set of code to your site. The code is added to a site only once and updates automatically when the ad setting is changed. These will work on any page on a multiple-page site, and this type of ad works on mobile. Note: If you have previously installed Page-level ads code, there is no need to generate and paste your ad code again, as both Page-level ads and Auto ads use the same ad code. How to enable Auto ads: Note: This option requires a custom domain linked to your site and listed on Google AdSense. Here's a guide about it . Sign in to your Google AdSense account and click Ads . In the table of all your sites, click Edit next to your site. Your site opens in the ad settings preview . Under \"Ad settings\", turn on Auto ads . Click Apply to site . Choose your save option: Click Apply now > Save , to immediately apply your Auto ads settings to your site. Click Run experiment first > Run experiment , to test your Auto ads settings. Your auto ads should appear on your site within 10 to 20 minutes. How it looks on mobile: In case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us .",

    "text": "How to Create a Dropdown Menu\n\nFor users who are looking to build complex websites with a lot more pages - adding dropdown menus to your site's navigation is a way to customize and organize your content. Here is what the dropdown menu looks like: After setting up a drop menu, you'll see that the dropdown title will have an arrow indicator. When your visitors hover over the dropdown title, a menu containing either links to pages on your site or links to external sites will expand. Please note that visitors will not be able to click on the dropdown title itself, only the items in the expanded menu. Step 1: Enabling the Dropdown Menu The dropdown menu option is only available to multi-page sites. You can enable the multiple-page functionality in your site's Settings panel - see our guide to creating a multi-page site here . Under your page manager, open the \"ADVANCED>\" option and click the [Add Dropdown Menu] button. You'll see that a new dropdown item has been added - you can add up to 10 dropdown menus in one site. Step 2: Name and Reposition the Dropdown Menu Now, rename the dropdown and drag the menu to the right order in the navigation menu. Please note that you will not be able to replace the homepage with a dropdown menu. The first item in the navigation menu must be a page (and not a dropdown menu or external link). Step 3: Add Items to the Dropdown Menu You can add up to 15 items (either pages or external links) to a single dropdown menu by dragging and dropping the pages or external links under the menu. Creating a Dropdown Menu for Sections If you want to create a dropdown menu that links to the sections of a page (rather than individual pages), use the external link functionality. Start off with a new dropdown menu. Add the link to the section by adding a new external link. For example, to create a dropdown item that links to the second section of this page http://sunnysideup.strikingly.com/photos, click [Add New link] under EXTERNAL LINKS and put the URL or select the page and section you want to link to. Next, move the external links to the dropdown menu. In this dropdown, \"Nature\" links to the first section of this page http://sunnysideup.strikingly.com/photos, and \"Urban\" links to the second section on the same page. Lastly, hide the original page that the sections are on by unchecking the \"Show in navigation\" option in the settings gear and publish your changes. After setting up the external links to sections in the dropdown menu, it will look like this: No te: The dropdown *header* does not link to anything. (e.g. clicking the \"Photos\" in the example below will not link to any other pages.) If you need to link this header to another page, this is possible using some custom code in your site. Just send us a message via support@strikingly.com or chat and we can add the code on your site to make this happen. Note: Currently, we only support dropdowns for the navigation bar. We do not support dropdowns for the footer. We hope you'll find this feature useful! Please let us know if you have any questions by emailing us at support@strikingly.com or chatting with us.

The slider section has three layouts: How do I add the new Slider section to my site? I would love to use this! To add a slider section, click on “Add New Section” (left panel of your site editor) and select “Media Slider” from the section list. Your slider section will now be added to your site! If you want to move your slider section, click and hold the three horizontal lines beside your section name. Drag it up or down, depending on where you want your slider section to be. I want to create a gallery of images using the sliders. How many slides can I add? You can add 20 slides for each section. If you want to create a gallery section, your images will be limited to 20. Can I change the order of the sliders? You can re-order the slides in the section by clicking the \"Slider\" button at the top right corner. You can click and drag the slides from the slider menu, then re-arrange them in the order that you'd like them displayed. Can you tell me the image size in the Slider Section (Fresh Template)? Sections collapse and expand depending on the content. If you want your slider section to expand, here’s a trick--click on any text box (with or without text) and add more spaces by hitting Enter (from your keyboard) a few times. The section will think you have more content so that it will expand! How can I reposition the text in the slider section? Try different layouts for a slide by clicking the [LAYOUT] button at the slider section's top right corner. If you want the text on the side but don’t want the foreground image, click on the latter and choose \"Remove\". How would the slider section look on my mobile? The background image will be scaled to fit your mobile screen. Depending on your background setting, it may be stretched or centered. The foreground image will appear on top of the text. The call-to-action button will be at the bottom of the section. I want to change the color of the button on my slider. Can I do that from my end? Yes! You can change the color of the button by clicking it and selecting \"Design\". Don't forget to click \"Save\" after customizing the color.

    "text": "Standard Troubleshooting Steps (When Everything Stops Working)\n\nHas your site editor stopped working? Did your image upload get stuck? Did your site stop working and just won't load? Do you feel like something is wrong? Before you say it's a bug, try the following steps first: 1. FORCE REFRESH your page ( live site only, not applicable for site editor ) -- to ensure that the site loading or the process is not affected by a full cache. Windows: CTRL + SHIFT + F5 Mac/Apple: Apple + SHIFT + R or COMMAND + SHIFT + R Linux: SHIFT+ F5 2. Use an INCOGNITO WINDOW or PRIVATE BROWSING WINDOW -- this ensures that certain browser extensions don't affect the process or the site you are loading. Chrome: SHIFT + Command + N (Mac); CTRL + SHIFT + N (Windows) Firefox: SHIFT + Command + P (Mac); CTRL + SHIFT + P (Windows) 3. Flush your DNS Cache . Here's how . (You can do this for live site issues, not for site editor or dashboard issues.) 4. Try a DIFFERENT BROWSER -- you usually need to use updated browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari. Internet Explorer usually yields different site issues when used. Try to toggle between the 3 previously mentioned browsers if you feel like something is not right with your site. If you've done everything and still you're getting the issue. Drop us a line at support@strikingly.com and let us know what you get when you go to the following: http://www.strikingly.com/s/browser .

    "text": "LinkedIn or Facebook Share Image Not Updating\n\n​ Have you ever gone to post the link of your website on Facebook, only to find that Facebook wasn't pulling in the latest version of that URL? The reason this happens is due to Facebook/LinkedIn caching everything. This means that Facebook or LinkedIn won't immediately pick up your changes. So, what's the solution? Use the Facebook Debugger to clear Facebook's cache. This is how Facebook sees your link! If you go to the debugger and drop in the URL you’re having trouble with, Facebook will actually reach out to your URL right then and grab the current content to display the debugger results. Doing this also clears Facebook’s cache of your page instantly. (sometimes you need to do it 2–3 times to get the latest updates.) After you link your URL, you can immediately go back and type your update in again, and the good stuff will show up. It’s that easy! Still not working and having a custom domain? If you are working with a custom domain, and Facebook is not recognizing your content, it is most likely because you have connected your domain incorrectly. You probably forward yourdomain.com to strikingly.com/yoursite. To fix it, follow our custom domain connection tutorial! Clearing LinkedIn’s Link Sharing Preview Cache 1. Access the LinkedIn Post Inspector here . If the link doesn't work, copy this URL to your browser: https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/inspect/ 2. Input your site URL and click the \"Inspect\" button. The updated share image will be shown on the preview. 3. Try sharing your URL again on LinkedIn to see if it is updated. In case the post inspector doesn't work, you may clear the sharing preview cache by tricking LinkedIn into \"thinking\" that your page is a brand new page. You can do this by adding an invented variable to the link when you share your site on LinkedIn. Example: Original link: http://www.domain.com/ \"New\" link: http://www.domain.com/?1 \"?1\" was added at the end of the site's URL. It will force the metadata to be recollected. Don't worry, it won't affect your webpage. In case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us. Create your own awesome website with Strikingly today!",

    "text": "Fixing Error Message: \"Framing is not allowed with free account\"\n\nWhat does this error message mean? You are seeing this message because: 1) You attempted to include your Strikingly site on another domain using an iframe -- this is called \"framing\" or \"masked forwarding\". Some domain registrars will do this if you try to activate URL forwarding to your Strikingly site. This also causes SEO and mobile issues. 2) You have a free account with us and you connected your domain to your Strikingly site via URL forwarding/redirect with masking/iframe. URL forwarding or custom domain connection is only available for Limited, Pro, and VIP users. Once you purchase a plan (either Limited or Pro), that error will go away. Once you've done this, we also have a tutorial on how you can properly connect your domain to your Strikingly site ! Let us know if you have any questions. You cannot forward but you can use a simple URL redirect from your domain registrar , so visitors going to your domain will be redirected to the strikingly.com domain, but this means that your visitors will see the strikingly.com domain in their URL bar. This solution does not require you to purchase a paid plan. To do this: 1. Log in to your domain registrar (where you purchased your domain). 2. Add domain forwarding from domain.com to http://page.mystrikingly.com (no masking/framing). 3. Add subdomain forwarding from www to http://page.mystrikingly.com (no masking/framing). If you're having trouble, send us an email at support@strikingly.com or chat with us. We'll be happy to set it up for you!",

Addendum: MASTER DOMAIN REGISTRATION AGREEMENT Domain registration services on Strikingly are provided through our domain provider, Tucows Domains Inc. THIS REGISTRATION AGREEMENT (\"Agreement\"), is between Tucows Domains Inc. (\"Tucows\") and you, on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent (\"Registrant\"), as offered through __________________ ___________________________, the Reseller participating in Tucows' distribution channel for domain name registrations. Any reference to \"Registry\" or \"Registry Operator\" shall refer to the registry administrator of the applicable top-level domain (\"TLD\"). This Agreement explains Tucows' obligations to Registrant, and Registrant's obligations to Tucows, for the domain registration services. By agreeing to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Registrant agrees to be bound by the rules and regulations set forth in this Agreement, and by a registry for that particular TLD. DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION. Domain name registrations are for a limited term, which ends on the expiration date communicated to the Registrant. A domain name submitted through Tucows will be deemed active when the relevant registry accepts the Registrant's application and activates Registrant's domain name registration or renewal. Tucows cannot guarantee that Registrant will obtain a desired domain name, even if an inquiry indicates that a domain name is available at the time of application. Tucows is not responsible for any inaccuracies or errors in the domain name registration or renewal process. FEES. The registrant agrees to pay Reseller the applicable service fees prior to the registration or renewal of a domain. All fees payable here under are non-refundable even if Registrant's domain name registration is suspended, canceled, or transferred prior to the end of your current registration term. TERM. This Agreement will remain in effect during the term of the domain name registration as selected, recorded, and paid for at the time of registration or renewal. Should the domain name be transferred to another registrar, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall cease. EXPIRATION, RENEWAL, AND FORFEITURE. The registered domain name will expire on the expiration date specified in the registration term, and as communicated to the Registrant. The registrant will receive reminders immediately prior to the expiration inviting Registrant to renew the domain name. In the event that Registrant fails to renew the domain name in a timely fashion, the registration will expire and Tucows may, at its discretion, elect to assume the registration and may hold it in its own account, delete it, or sell it to a third party. During the period following the expiration of a domain name, the domain name will cease to resolve, the Whois registration records may be revised to include that of Tucows or its reseller, and visitors to the Registrant's website may be directed to a default web page. This default web page may feature advertisements posted by Tucows for its own account. Registrant acknowledges and agrees that Registrant's right and interest in a domain name ceases upon its expiration. The registrant is solely responsible for informing itself of the date of expiration and renewing its registration in a timely manner. If Tucows, in its sole discretion, elects to renew the registration, Registrant will be entitled to a grace period of forty (40) days during which the Registrant may re-register the domain name. Additional costs for the redemption and re-registration will apply. EXPIRED REGISTRATION RECOVERY POLICY. Domain expiration notices will be sent via email thirty (30) days and five (5) days prior to a domain expiration date and three (3) days after a domain expires. Renewal, post-expiration renewal, and redemptions fees are published at https://opensrs.com/services/domains/domain-pricing/ . Reseller's fees may differ. REGISTRANT INFORMATION AND DATA_SHARING. Data required for the registration of a domain name varies by top-level domain. The required data for a domain name registration (“Minimum Data”) will be presented at the time of registration or renewal and may include up to: Name and postal address of the Registered Name Holder; Registered name; Names of the primary nameserver and secondary nameserver(s) for the Registered Name; Name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax (if available) telephone numbers of the administrative contact for the domain name; Name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax (if available) telephone numbers of the billing contact for the domain name; and Name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax (if available) telephone numbers of the technical contact for the domain name. The Minimum Data will be shared with Tucows and the relevant authoritative registry services provider for your top-level domain. The identity of the authoritative registry services provider can be found at https://www.iana.org/whois . The Minimum Data for domains in any TLD you have registered can be found on the Data Use Information Page . ACCURATE INFORMATION. Registrant represents and warrants that: The statements that Registrant makes in connection with the domain name registration, maintenance, or renewal are complete and accurate; Registrant information will be kept current; Registrant will not and will not permit others to use the domain name in violation of any ICANN or registry policies, applicable laws or regulations, or legal rights of others; Registrant will respond to inquiries from Tucows addressed to the email address of the Registrant, the administrative, billing or technical contact with respect to a domain name concerning the accuracy of contact details. Registrant acknowledges that a breach of this Section 8 will constitute a material breach of the Agreement, which will entitle either Tucows or a registry to terminate this Agreement immediately upon such breach without any refund and without notice to Registrant. ACCOUNT REVIEW, DATA MODIFICATION, OR DELETION. To access, view, update, delete, or download data associated with your domain name registration, you must be signed into your account. If you make a request to delete your personal data and that data is necessary for the products or services you have purchased, the request will be honored only to the extent it is no longer necessary for any services purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements. In some cases, when data is necessary for the provisioning of service, deletion of data may cancel or suspend the services you have purchased. If you have difficulty accessing your data, modifying it, or deleting it, you may request assistance by sending an email to DPA @ Tucows.com or using the contact information at https://opensrs.com/privacy-policy/. ICANN-REQUIRED DISCLOSURES. Domain name registration requires sharing the Registrant's information, in whole or in part, with the applicable Registry Operator and with ICANN. Both Tucows and the Registry Operator may be required to archive this information with a third-party escrow service. Further, Registrant represents and warrants that, if the Registrant is providing information about a third party, the Registrant has notified the third party of the required disclosures and the purpose for the disclosures and the Registrant has obtained the third party's consent to such disclosure. ICANN may establish or modify the guidelines, limits, or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that Tucows may or must make available to the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available. SUSPENSION AND CANCELLATION. Tucows may in its sole discretion, suspend or cancel Registrant's domain name registration: if Registrant breaches this Agreement; if Registrant fails to provide payment or accurate contact or billing information; in the event there was an error in the registration process for such a domain name; as required by ICANN or a Registry Operator; to protect the integrity and stability of Tucows and any applicable registry; to comply with any applicable laws, government rules, requests of law enforcement, and court orders; in compliance with any dispute resolution process; or to avoid any liability, civil or criminal. DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Registrant is bound by all ICANN consensus policies and all policies of any relevant Registry Operator, including the Uniform Rapid Suspension Procedure, the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution policy (UDRP), along with the UDRP rules and all supplemental rules of any UDRP provider. ICANN may change the UDRP at any time. If a third party challenges the registration or reservation of the Registrant's domain name, Registrant will be subject to the provisions specified in the dispute policy adopted by the applicable registry. In the event a domain name dispute arises, Registrant will indemnify and hold Tucows harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable policy. If Tucows is notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or administrative body regarding a domain name, Tucows may, at its sole discretion, suspend the use of the domain name and the ability to make modifications to the registration records until: Tucows is directed to do so by the judicial or administrative body, or Tucows receives notification from both parties that the dispute has been settled. If Registrant or Registrant's domain name becomes the subject of litigation, Tucows may deposit control of the Registrant's domain name record into the registry of the judicial body by supplying a party with a registrar certificate. WHOIS PRIVACY SERVICE . If Registrant elects to use the Whois privacy registration service, the following terms and conditions will apply: The publicly available Registrant contact information will list Contact Privacy Inc. Customer #### (where #### is a unique customer identification number) as the Registrant and contact name, and Tucows' postal address, assigned email address, and telephone number as contact information. Tucows will keep the Registrant and Contact Information provided by Registrant on file. Both Tucows and the Registry may be required to archive this information with a third-party escrow service, as per ICANN policy. Registrant will retain complete control over the domain name and its registration records and may suspend and reinstate the Whois Privacy Service at its discretion. With respect to a domain name that has been transferred to Tucows, the Whois Privacy Service will only commence after the transfer has been completed. If Registrant elects to transfer a domain name to a different registrar, the Whois Privacy Service must be disabled in order to initiate the transfer. Tucows will send all obligatory renewal and transfer-related messages to the contacts that Registrant has designated. Pricing for the Whois privacy registration service will be set by the Reseller, and Registrant will pay Reseller for this service. Communications received with respect to a domain name registration will be handled as follows: o Tucows will forward to Registrant all correspondence received by registered mail or traceable courier. This information may be opened, scanned, and emailed to Registrant. Regular postal mail will be discarded or returned to the sender at Tucows' discretion. o Email correspondence will be forwarded, only if submitted via the contactprivacy.com website. o A voicemail message will advise all callers that inbound messages will not be accepted; calls will be directed to the contactprivacy.com website. o The point of contact for third parties wishing to report abuse or infringement of trademarks (or other rights) is legal@tucows.com. The business contact information for the Whois privacy registration service is: Contact Privacy Inc. 96 Mowat Ave Toronto (ON) M6K 3M1 CANADA Tucows shall have the right, at its sole discretion and without liability to Registrant, to suspend or cancel the Whois Privacy Service and to reveal Registrant and Contact Whois Information in certain circumstances, including but not limited to the following: o when required by law; o in the good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to further determination of an alleged breach of a law; o to comply with a legal process served upon Tucows; o to resolve any and all third-party claims including but not limited to ICANN's or a Registry's dispute resolution policy; o to avoid financial loss or legal liability; o if Tucows believes that Registrant or one of Registrant's contacts is using the Whois Privacy Service to conceal involvement with illegal, illicit, objectionable, or harmful activities; or to transmit SPAM, viruses, worms, or other harmful computer programs. POLICY. The registrant agrees that its registration of the domain name shall be subject to suspension, cancellation, or transfer pursuant to a Tucows, registry, ICANN, or government-adopted policy, or pursuant to any registrar or registry procedure not inconsistent with a Tucows, registry, ICANN, or government-adopted policy, to correct mistakes by Tucows or a registry in registering the name or for the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name. TRADEMARK CLEARINGHOUSE (TMCH). Registrant agrees to abide by the terms and conditions set forth by Tucows and the Trademark Clearinghouse Agreement available at http://opensrs.com/site/resources/agreements#contracts . NO GUARANTEE. Registrant acknowledges that registration of a chosen domain name does not confer immunity from objection to the registration, reservation, or use of the domain name. AGENCY. If Registrant intends to license the use of a domain name to a third party, Registrant is deemed the domain name holder of record and is responsible for providing Registrant's own full contact information adequate to facilitate the timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name. Registrant shall accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the domain name, unless it promptly discloses the licensee's identity and current contact information (as provided by the licensee) to a party providing the Registered Name Holder reasonable evidence of actionable harm. Registrant represents that it will secure the agreement of any third party to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. MODIFICATIONS TO AGREEMENT . Tucows may modify this Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement, as is necessary to comply with its agreements with ICANN, a registry or any other entity or individual, as well as to adjust to changing circumstances. All amendments to this Agreement will be posted on our website at http://www.opensrs.com/docs/contracts/exhibita.htm. Your continued use of the registered domain name will constitute your acceptance of this Agreement with any revisions. If you do not agree to any change, you may request that your domain name be canceled or transferred to a different accredited registrar, and agree that such cancellation or transfer will be your exclusive remedy if you do not wish to abide by any change to this Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement. ANNOUNCEMENTS. Tucows reserves the right to distribute information to Registrant that is required by ICANN or Registry policy. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Registrant agrees that Tucows' entire liability, and Registrant's exclusive remedy, with respect to the domain registration service provided under this Agreement and any breach of this Agreement, is solely limited to the amount Registrant paid for the initial registration of the domain name. Tucows, ICANN, and the applicable registries shall not be liable for any lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses, or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states, liability is limited to the extent permitted by law. INDEMNITY. Registrant will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Tucows, ICANN, the applicable registries, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, and contractors, from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including attorney's fees, arising out of or relating to Registrant's registration and use of the domain name registered; use of the domain name in violation of this Agreement; or Registrant's violation of any third-party right, including Intellectual Property Rights. This indemnification obligation will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP. The person named as Registrant on record with Tucows shall be the \"Registered Name Holder.\" If designated, the person named as administrative contact at the time the controlling account was secured shall be deemed the designate of the Registrant with the authority to manage the domain name. Registrant agrees that prior to transferring ownership of the domain name to another person (the \"Transferee\") Registrant shall require the Transferee to agree, in writing to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Transferee fails to be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determined by Tucows in its sole discretion) to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, any such transfer will be null and void. Registrant explicitly authorizes Tucows to act as their Designated Agent, as stipulated by the ICANN Transfer Policy, to approve a Change of Registrant on their behalf. BREACH . Registrant agrees that failure to abide by any provision of this Agreement, any ICANN, Registry, URDP, or Dispute operating rule or policy, may be considered by Tucows to be a material breach, and that Tucows may provide a written notice, describing the breach, to Registrant. If within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of such notice, Registrant fails to provide evidence, which is reasonably satisfactory to Tucows, that Registrant has not breached its obligations under the Agreement, then Tucows may delete the registration of the domain name. Any such breach by Registrant shall not be deemed to be excused simply because Tucows did not act earlier in response to that, or any other, breach by Registrant. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. Except for the express warranties in this Agreement, Tucows does not make any other warranty of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Tucows is not responsible or liable for the deletion or failure to store any content and other communications maintained or transmitted through the use of the domain name registration service. Tucows does not warrant that the domain name registration service will be error-free or uninterrupted. The domain name registration service is not intended for high-risk activities. INCONSISTENCIES WITH REGISTRY POLICIES . In the event that this Agreement may be inconsistent with any term, condition, policy, or procedure of an applicable Registry, the term, condition, policy, or procedure of the applicable Registry shall prevail. NON-WAIVER . Tucows failure to require performance by Registrant of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by Tucows of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. NOTICES. Any notice, direction, or other communication given under this Agreement shall be in writing and given by sending it via e-mail or via regular mail. In the case of e-mail, valid notice shall only have been deemed to be given when an electronic confirmation of delivery has been obtained by the sender.

    "text": "Strikingly Domain: Buy & Register Your Own Custom Domain\n\nHow to register a domain? Your domain purchase is separate from your website subscription purchase. You must upgrade to a Limited, Pro, or VIP plan (if you haven't yet) to connect your domain. Before You Register If you're within the first year of the Strikingly paid plan, you're eligible for one free custom domain (worth $24.95). If you're on a trial or a monthly plan, or if you want multiple domains, you will need to pay for the domains per year. Domains purchased through Strikingly start at US$24.95 per year. The exact pricing depends on which top-level domain (TLD) extension you choose, such as .com, .org, or .net. You can check the price and availability of your domain by searching your domain dashboard . Strikingly Domains are set to renew and charge automatically each year 7 days before the expiration date. Once you connect your domain, we'll automatically hook the domain up to your site, so you won't need to manage domain settings. Domains purchased through Strikingly include domain privacy. You can't change your domain names after registering/purchasing. Domain registrations/purchases are non-refundable. If you are ready to proceed, follow these steps: Step 1: Choose Your Own Domain If you are on your site editor If you are on your dashboard Step 2: Fill in Your Personal Information Step 3: Verify Your Domain Ownership via Email (very important) Step 4: Connect Your Strikingly Domain to Your Site Step 5: Wait for the Records to Take Effect Step 1: Choose Your Own Domain If you are on your site editor 1. Go to your site editor, and click \" SETTINGS > Domains \". 2. Look for the \" REGISTER NEW DOMAIN \" box, type in your preferred domain name, and click \"Search Domain\".

Go to your Strikingly Dashboard > \" Domains \" and click \" REGISTER NEW DOMAIN \". 2. Type in your desired domain name and click \" SEARCH DOMAIN \". A list of suggested domains displays, you will see these results: Available - You can purchase this domain for a specified price. Free for the first year - If you're already on a yearly plan, you can pick one of these domains to register for free or pay for the differences. To learn more, visit Strikingly Domain: Free Offer / Domain Credit . Not available - It's not possible to purchase these domains. You can check the suggestions list instead. 3. Pick the year you want to have your domain for (default is 1 year). 4. Click \" REGISTER \". Step 2: Fill in Your Personal Information 1. Fill out all the fields. Every field is required. Your personal information will be listed as the owner of the domain, but it's private, and won't be shown or shared with the public. WHOIS/Domain Privacy is included with all Strikingly Domains. 2. Make sure to put in a working email. An email verification will be sent after the purchase to verify your domain ownership. If you have an Apple email (@me.com, @apple.com, @icloud.com), we'd encourage you to use a different email to ensure that you receive your verification email. 3. All the information should be authentic, or the registration might fail. 4. Click \" SUBMIT \". 5. Review your personal information details. 6. Keep \"Auto-renew my domain\" checked if you want your domain to be automatically charged and renewed for you 7 days before the expiration date. 7. Click \" CONFIRM PAYMENT \" and you will be billed immediately. If you don't have billing information saved yet, you will be required to enter the details of your card or PayPal before you click the \"Confirm Payment\" button. Note : If you purchase the wrong name by accident, we can not refund the registration cost. However, you can remove the auto-renewal to avoid renewing next year. Then register a new or correct domain name. Step 3: Verify Your Domain Ownership via Email (very important) After you confirm the domain purchase, you'll receive an email with the title \" VERIFICATION REQUIRED - Please verify your domain name(s) as soon as possible \" within 24 hours from support@strikingly.com asking you to verify your email address . The email is sent to the address you entered during registration. If you don't receive a verification email, then check your email's Spam/Junk folder. If you don't verify your email address, your domain might be suspended. Email verification is a very important step in this process. You must verify your domain from this email within 15 days of registration or it will be suspended. Read more here: Strikingly Domain: Verify your Domain via email . Step 4: Connect Your Strikingly Domain to Your Strikingly Site If you purchase your domain from the site editor, your Strikingly domain will be connected to your site automatically. If you purchase your domain from the dashboard, you'll need to manually connect your Strikingly domain to your site. Note: You must be on a paid plan to use the \"custom domain connection\" feature. 1. Go to your Strikingly site editor, and click \"SETTINGS > Domains\". 2. Put your Strikingly domain in the \" Connect a Domain You Already Own \" box, such as \"www.yourdomain.com\" (without https:// or http:// or /). 3. Click \" UPDATE \". NOTE: Type your domain in lowercase to avoid the \" Page not found \" error when accessing your site. If you purchased your domain from Strikingly, you're done! If it's from a third-party registrar, click here and follow the next steps. Step 5: Wait for the Records to Take Effect Once done connecting your domain, please allow a few up to 48 hours for the changes in the domain records to take effect globally. Once it's up, HTTPS/SSL will be automatically activated within 24 hours. Be sure to clear your browser cache before you check to see if the domain is working. After you complete your own domain, you might also want to get a professional business email address, visit Strikingly Email: Creating Custom Email Addresses . FAQ 1. How much does registering a new domain cost? The cost of registering a new domain depends on the TLD (top-level domain, ie .com, .net) you choose. However, you'll be billed $24.95 per year for registering domains with the extensions .com, .net, .org, .co, and .me. 2. Can you register my domain for me? Domain registration requires personal and sensitive information like credit card information. We like to keep your information private, so we won't be able to register your domain for you. 3. How long should I wait before my site is up? Normally, it takes a few up to 48 hours for the changes in the domain records to take effect globally. Once it's up, HTTPS/SSL will be automatically activated within 24 hours. Be sure to clear your browser cache before you check to see if the domain is working. 4. Can I get more than one custom domain? Yes! You can get as many as you want. When you register a domain through Strikingly, we'll automatically hook it up through the settings of the site you're buying it on -- if you're buying extra domains, make sure to check what page you're using. Maybe you'd like yourname.com, yourproject.com, and event2014.com! Or if you like to add subdomains, like shop.yourdomain.com, or info.yourdomain.com, you can visit Strikingly Domain: Creating Subdomains . Or Connecting Multiple Domains to One Strikingly Site . 5. Can I manage my own domain settings or transfer my domain away from Strikingly? Yes! If your domain's DNS manager isn't activated yet, contact us at support@strikingly.com . Once you log in to your domain dashboard, you'll be able to manage host records or transfer your domain. This way, you can add subdomains, manage redirects, and more. Here's more about Strikingly Domain: Viewing Domain Info and Managing DNS Records . If you want to change your domain host (including billing and renewal), you can visit Strikingly Domain: Transferring Domains Away . 6. What TLDs are available?

    "text": "Increase Search Engine Ranking (SEO)\n\nSearch engines rank sites to help people find the best and most relevant sites. Search engines take time to examine and index your site, and thus it takes time for SEO to increase or for links listed to change. They know what the \"tricks\" are. Keep in mind it depends on various factors including content, descriptions, link-backs, host, URL, and more! Note : When you switch to and from websites (content or URL), your SEO may be refreshed as well, so you may have to work on these elements again. 1. Write a descriptive title The title of your site is what shows up in the tab at the top of your browser, address bar, search engine results, and social shares. This is like the front door of your page. Make it attractive! For example, \" Johnny's Bakery - Freshly Baked every day in San Francisco \" is much better than \" Johnny's Shop .\" Visit Changing Site/Page Title and read more from Google: Create descriptive page titles . 2. Add site and page meta descriptions Add a description to your site and every page . The meta description (meta tags) is the snippet that summarizes the site's content on the search engine results page - and adding it to your site is very important for improving your site's search engine ranking. However, be careful not to include keywords just for the sake of increasing your ranking, as many search engines demote this behavior (keyword stuffing) and rank you lower. Good description: \" Johnny's Bakery is a gourmet bakery and confectionery based in the Mission in San Francisco. We started in 1965 and we've been offering delightful bread, cakes, pies, and cookies to happy customers ever since! \" 3. Add keywords to your headings Headings are the big text boxes that are located throughout your site. Titles are important for SEO because search engines give additional weight to heading text. So, it's better to add descriptive text in the headings. For instance, \"A bout Johnny's Bakery \" is better than \" About \" as a heading for your \"About\" section. To learn more, visit Adding Heading Tags (H1, H2...) and Adding Keywords (Search Phrases) for SEO. 4. Produce high-quality content Content is king. Do keyword research and write content that is recent, valuable, helpful, and relevant for the visitors. The higher the quality of content, the higher the website will be ranked by search engines. Adding a blog to your site is a great way to help search engines see your site as active and good for your business. Updating your blog regularly with relevant and high-quality content can benefit your SEO, gain visitors, and build your brand. Learn more. 5. Add descriptions to all images Since search engines don't understand images, they look for image descriptions. An image description will help search engines index your image, which helps index your site. Also, try to keep your image sizes under 200KB. The best size for website images (desktop and laptop) is around 50KB. This will improve performance and experience! 6. Connect a domain to your Strikingly site Connecting yourname.com or yourcompany.com strengthens your brand and helps potential visitors find your site. Visit Connecting a Domain to Your Strikingly Site . If you want to use a Strikingly Free URL , your https://xxx.mystrikingly.com URL has good SEO and loads quickly as well! 7. Actively share your site on other websites A huge part of search engine ranking comes from backlinks and traffic. That means the more sites that link to your site, and the higher the quality of those sites, the better your search engine ranking will be. Start posting your site on blogs, forums, and social media! Create a Google Plus profile, if relevant. Include your URL in your LinkedIn profile, email signature, and other networks. Find the places where people are interested in what you do and share! 8. Verify your site with Google Search Console Google Search Console is a free service that helps your site find on Google quicker! To learn more, visit Verifying Google Search Console and Submitting Sitemap . 9. Use Strikingly built-in analytics Check which pages get you traffic, where your visitors are coming from, and more.

    "text": "Fixing Background Image Issues\n\nBackground images on Strikingly are meant to conform to various screen sizes, so parts of the background may be cropped depending on the screen size. (If viewing on a monitor, the top and bottom of the image may be cropped. If viewing on a phone in portrait mode, the left and right sides of the image may be cropped.) For a more optimized background setting, an image dimension of 1600 x 900 px should do nicely. Keep this in mind when you upload background images with content in them (faces, text, etc) . If your background images contain content, it's best to keep it in the center of the image and ensure enough space on the edges so cropping won't cut off your content. Another method is to upload the content as an image on top of the background, but this is only doable with specific sections. It's also possible to alter your background image's positioning/scaling settings. If you need to display the entire image, try setting the scale option to \"Contain\". If you want the entire section to be covered by the image all the time, try \"Stretch\". Learn more at Backgrounds & Image Settings .

Google indexes websites once every 2-5 days or even longer. When Google re-indexes your site, it will be fixed! Thanks for your patience.

Do this by going to Settings > Advanced > Privacy & Legal, then tick the \"Hide from search engines\" box.

Strikingly is designed to handle a wide range of image sizes for various screen sizes, sections, layouts, and templates. But sometimes it's still good to have an idea about which image dimensions to upload. Here are some general guidelines! First, take note of roughly how wide the image appears on the page. Background images: 1600x900px. Read this article for more guidelines. Full-width images: At least 1400px wide for the highest quality. (Height doesn't matter.) Half-width images: At least 700px wide for the highest quality. (Height doesn't matter.) 1/3 width images: At least 480px wide for the highest quality. (Height doesn't matter.) 1/4 width images: At least 360px wide for the highest quality. (Height doesn't matter.) Small icons/logos: At least 100px wide. Gallery images : Any size is fine! Gallery images will open in a lightbox overlaid on top of your site. REMEMBER: These pixel dimensions ARE NOT EXACT. This is because Strikingly optimizes for a wide range of screen sizes, from large TVs to tiny phones, so there is not one single pixel width for any image. These guidelines only ensure quality for a large range of image sizes. What if my images are too small? Generally, if your images are a bit smaller than recommended, it's not a problem at all -- they will just have some extra space on the sides. But if your images are much smaller than recommended, there will be a lot of extra space, and that extra space could look bad. You can consider changing layouts, or using a different section instead! What if my images are too large? If the dimensions are too large, but the file size is below 15 MB, that's not a problem! We'll automatically scale down images, so they load fast, and your visitors are not downloading unnecessarily large images. Got any more questions?

    "text": "Strikingly Domain: Transferring Domains vs. Connecting Domains\n\nWhen creating a website on Strikingly, you have the flexibility to use your existing domain, even if it was purchased from another provider like Godaddy or Namecheap. Strikingly offers two methods to link your domain with your site: connecting and transferring. This article aims to clarify the difference between these two methods and help you decide which option best suits your needs. Transferring a Domain to Strikingly Transferring a domain lets you manage both your domain and website through Strikingly. Strikingly becomes your domain host when you transfer your domain to Strikingly. It means: You can manage your domain DNS from your Strikingly account. You can renew your domain from your Strikingly account. Your domain will be automatically configured once it's connected. Note: Your account must be upgraded to a Premium Plan before you can connect a domain to your site. Connecting a Domain to Strikingly Your Strikingly site goes live when you enter your domain name into a web browser once you've connected your domain to Strikingly. If you cannot transfer your domain, you can connect the domain instead. Your current domain host continues hosting your domain. You need to add two DNS records to point your domain to Strikingly. If you want to transfer your domain to Strikingly, visit Strikingly Domain: Transferring Domains To Strikingly . If you have issues transferring, you can connect your Domain to your Strikingly site. If you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us .",

    "text": "Common Google Search Console Error Messages\n\nWhen setting up the Google Search console , it requires your domain to be verified. The verification process can sometimes be tricky and you might encounter a few errors . We've listed down some of the errors, the possible causes, and how to resolve them. Error #1: “Could not find your site. Please check that you provided the correct URL for your property.” Error #2: “We couldn’t find your verification meta tag.” Error #3: “Your meta tag is incorrect. Are you using a meta tag for a different site or user account? Found meta tag:” Error #4: “The connection to your server timed out” Error #5: “We could not find your verification token in your domain’s TXT records.” Error #6: Sitemap “Couldn’t Fetch” Error Error #1 : “Could not find your site. Please check that you provided the correct URL for your property.” Possible Cause 1: The site is hidden from search engines. Resolution: Disable the option from the site editor's Settings: Go to Site Editor > Settings > Show Advanced > Privacy & Legal. Uncheck the \"Hide from Search Engines\". Click \"Save\". Publish the site. Possible Cause 2: The site is password-protected. Resolution: Disable the option from the site editor's Settings: Go to Site Editor > Settings > Show Advanced > Privacy & Legal. Empty the box under \"Password Protection\". Click \"Save\". Publish the site. Possible Cause 3: The site URL used to submit property is different from the actual site URL. Examples: Submitted URL Actual Site URL old .mystrikingly.com new .mystrikingly.com site.mystrikingly .com www.newsiteurl .com http: //www.siteurl.com https: //www.siteurl.com Resolution: Before verifying the site, make sure that the submitted site URL is correct and the most current. You can check for the domain being used by the site by going to Site Editor > Settings> Domains. Error #2: “We couldn’t find your verification meta tag.” Possible Causes: a. Verification method is not supported. b. The HTML tag has not been added yet. c. HTML tag was added but: - Site was not published after saving the tag. - Site was published and you clicked “Verify” immediately (did not wait for 5-15 minutes). Resolution: Make sure that before the verification is correct and added correctly added within the site editor. Also, make sure to give it enough time for the updates to take effect. Error #3: “Your meta tag is incorrect. Are you using a meta tag for a different site or user account? Found meta tag:” Possible Causes: a. Site was cloned but the verification tag was not changed. b. Site was transferred from one user to another. The new owner tried to verify the site without removing the old tag. c. Old verification meta tag was removed and a new one was added, but the live site was not updated yet (after publishing). Resolution: This error is usually caused by not updating the meta tag. Always make sure the tags are updated when cloning and make sure to publish the site when changes are made. Error #4: “The connection to your server timed out” Possible Causes: 1. This could occur if our servers are down or our platform is responding slowly. 2. Sometimes the cause could be unknown. Resolution: In this case, it's best to wait 3-5 minutes and try to verify the site again. Error #5: “We could not find your verification token in your domain’s TXT records.” Possible Cause: The TXT records have just been added, and Google Search Console cannot detect them yet on the domain’s DNS. Resolution: Wait for the propagation of the TXT records, then try again. Domain DNS records usually update globally within 24–48 hours. You may have to wait it out a bit before retrying the verification. Error #6: Sitemap “Couldn’t Fetch” Error First, make sure your sitemap URL is accurate and accessible. If the error persists, click \"Couldn't fetch\" for more details on the issue. Possible Cause 1: Sitemap could not be read Resolution for \"Sitemap could not be read\": This is usually your site prevents search engines to fetch. You can disable the \" Hide from Search Engines \" option. Possible Cause 2: Robots.txt unreachable Resolution for \"Robots.txt unreachable\": - Sometimes, this issue can be temporary. Wait for 10 minutes to 24 hours, then try fetching the sitemap again. - If you're using a free Strikingly URL, other sites on mystrikingly.com might affect yours. For instance, if a site on mystrikingly.com violates Google's policies, it might affect the shared domain, including your site. To avoid any such potential issues, it's a good idea to Connecting a Domain to Your Strikingly Site . This will help avoid potential issues with shared domains.

    "text": "Live Site Error: \"Your connection is not private/secure\"\n\nAfter you set up your domain, it takes a few up to 48 hours for the domain records to take effect globally. Once it's done, HTTPS/SSL will be automatically activated within 24 hours. During this time, you might see an error when you use HTTPS:// to visit your website. For example: Your connection is not private - Google Chrome Your connection is not secure - Mozilla Firefox There is a problem connecting securely to this website - Microsoft Edge. If you still encounter the \"not secure or not private\" error after setting up your domain's records for more than 24 hours, you can try the following troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue. 1. Check if your domain is configured correctly. The record type you selected is \"CNAME\". You changed the example records to your own domain name. For example: Your domain is www.example.com , the value should be: www.example.com .s.strikinglydns.com Your domain is www.abc.net , the value should be: www.abc.net .s.strikinglydns.com Your domain is www.yourdomain.com , the value should be: www.yourdomain.com .s.strikinglydns.com 2. Check if you are using A record for your root domain. If you use forwarding for your root domain domain.com, then it will not have HTTPS/SSL. You can set up an A record instead. 1) D elete your current forwarding. 2) Add an A record pointing to 54.183.102.22 . Note: If you have other A Records in your account: Host: @ - delete it if it's not pointing to 54.183.102.22. Host: blank - delete. Host: Mail or Email - do not delete. This is for your email service. Once your domain records are set up correctly and take effect, HTTPS/SSL will be automatically activated within 24 hours.

    "text": "Strikingly Domain: Transferring Domains Away\n\nYou can transfer a Domain from Strikingly to another provider if it's been at least 60 days since it was registered. If you want to connect your domain to another platform, you can edit your DNS records or ask us to do it for you. Before You Transfer You need to wait for 1 to 2 weeks for the domain transfer to complete from the time you entered the authorization/EPP code at your new provider. You need to monitor and reply to confirmation emails to complete the transfer process. During the transfer, all the DNS records will stop working . Your domain may go offline during the transfer period. Or if you have domain emails, your email may not work. Check with your email provider to ensure there won't be any restrictions or issues by transferring the domain away from Strikingly. Your domain has been registered for more than 60 days , as per the ICANN Transfer Policy . If you recently changed your domain contact info ie email, name, etc. the domain will be locked for 60 days before it can be transferred, per ICANN Change of Registrant Policy . Make sure to begin the transfer at least one week before your domain’s grace period ends. If your domain is already in the redemption period, you’ll need to renew it first. If the transfer starts at the end of the grace period and the domain enters redemption during the process, the transfer will fail. Please note that some domain TLDs don’t have a grace period, so be sure to start the transfer at least one week before the expiration date. Your domain contact email address is correct, and you have access to it. If you are ready to proceed, follow these steps: Step 1: Request to Release Your Domain Step 2: Check Your Email for Authorization/EPP Code Step 3: Monitor and Respond to Confirmation Emails Step 4: Wait for the Transfer to Complete Step 1: Request to Release Your Domain 1. Go to Strikingly Dashboard > Domains > SETTINGS and check if the domain is registered for more than 60 days. 2. Send us a request at support@strikingly.com or chat with us to release your domain. 3. After we release your domain, we will: Disable your domain's WHOIS/Domain privacy. Unlock your domain for transfer. Send the authorization/EPP code to the email that you registered when you purchased the domain from Strikingly. Step 2: Check Your Email for Authorization/EPP Code 1. Go to the email that you registered when you purchased the domain from Strikingly. 2. Get the authorization/EPP code to the receiving registrar (where you'll transfer the domain) so they can start processing the transfer. Step 3: Monitor and Respond to Confirmation Emails For the domain transfer to continue, you must confirm the transfer approval email sent to you within the transfer period. Failure to do so during the five-day transfer period may prevent the process from completing. Please check your email's spam/junk folder, in case you haven't received the approval email in your inbox. Step 4: Wait for the Transfer to Complete During the domain transfer, your site may go offline. A domain's nameservers/DNS settings cannot be changed during a Registrar transfer. Once your domain is available on the new registrar’s side, you can check if your site is up and if not, you need to set it up again on your new registrar’s side.

    "text": "Using Your Strikingly Built-in Analytics\n\nStrikingly's Analytics dashboard gives you a view of how many site visitors you have and where (by country) they are from. We also break down the traffic sources - e.g. direct traffic, social media platforms, or traffic from other sites. Before You Begin The stats data is not real-time . Please allow up to a few hours of delay for our system to process the raw stats data and reflect the update on the stats diagram. The data shown on Google Analytics might be different from Strikingly's Built-in Analytics. This is because: The definition of \"unique views\" on Google Analytics is different from our system. Google Analytics drops cookies on a visitor's browser and uses cookies to decide whether the visitor has visited your site before, while we use IP to determine that. There are pros and cons to both ways, and we choose to use the IP way. For geographic distributions of views/visits, it's possible that our system and Google Analytics use different geo-IP databases and have a slight difference. The time zone used when querying stats data can be different. Our system uses UTC to do the query. However, the analytics displayed are based on your browser. Some Google Analytics views apply sampling to the stats data if your site has numerous page views, so it can be slightly different from Strikingly stats. To Use Your Strikingly Built-in Analytics: Find Your Analytics Dashboard Reading Your Analytics Analytics Overview Visitors Analytics Store Analytics Blog Analytics Contacts, Signups, Subscriptions Analytics File Downloads Analytics Find Your Analytics Dashboard From your Strikingly Dashboard, click the \" x VIEWS LAST 7 DAYS \" button next to your site. If you have more than 10 sites, you can click \" View Stats \" to see more stats. This is because we want to make sure your dashboard loads faster, so we only load stats from the last 7 days for 10 sites at most. You can also go to your site editor > \" SETTINGS \" > \" ANALYTICS \" to view your site's statistics. Reading Your Analytics Analytics Overview Unique Visitors - Past 24 Hours/Week/Month/3 Months - the total count of unique views during the period you choose. You can click the tab on top to choose the period. Top Country - Where the most visitors came from Note: Our system considers all visits from the same IP during a certain time period as 1 unique view during that period. For example, if your site had 3 visits from the same IP yesterday and 4 visits from the same IP today, you would have 1 unique view for yesterday, 1 unique view for today, and 1 unique view (not 2) for the past week from that IP. Visitors Analytics Top Pages - the most popular pages. Countries - where visitors are browsing from. Devices - which device are the visitors using: desktop or mobile. Traffic Sources - where visitors are coming from before landing on your site (direct, search engines, etc.). Direct Traffic - visiting your site by manually typing in a URL, rather than coming to your site from another page. www.yourdomain.com - visiting your site by clicking on your site logo or the “Back to the Site” button on your blog posts and redirected to your site. Store Analytics Store Analytics provides valuable insights into your sales performance. Here are some key metrics you can review on your sales report: Revenue - total sales revenue value of all orders at the chosen time and at all times. Order Received - total count of all received orders at the chosen time and at all times. Sales Funnel - which sales funnel drove the most revenue. Blog Analytics Top Viewed Blog Posts - the most popular blog posts. Contacts, Signups, Subscriptions Analytics Contact Form Responses - total count of all received responses at the chosen time and at all times. File Downloads Analytics File Downloads - total count of downloads in the chosen time. You can also find the total count of downloads for each file in the editor. 1. Go to the editor, and open the file uploading window (Visit here to check how to open the file uploading window ). 2. Click the \" UPLOADED FILES \" tab. 3. There's a \" Downloads \" column that shows the count of downloads. Feel free to email us or chat with us if you have more questions!",

    "text": "Strikingly Email: Check Emails through Email Clients using IMAP(or POP3) and SMTP\n\nSet up IMAP and change your SMTP settings to read email messages in other mail clients, like Windows Mail, iPhone, etc. When you use IMAP, you can read your email messages on multiple devices, and messages are synced in real-time. If you don't have a custom email address, visit Strikingly Email: Creating Custom Email Addresses . On this page: What is IMAP? What is POP3? What is SMTP? Why should I use IMAP and not POP3? How do I set up IMAP and SMTP? What is IMAP? Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) allows you to access your email from the server. The emails are stored on the server and it syncs with all devices where you have your email configured. When a new email comes in and you read it on your phone, your email will show \"Read\" when you access your email on your laptop. What is POP3? Post Office Protocol (POP) allows you to also access your email on whatever device you have your email configured. However, the emails are not stored on any server. For instance, if you open your email client on your phone, your new emails are downloaded on your phone and are not stored on the server. When you access your email from your computer, it will not download the emails previously downloaded on your phone. What is SMTP? Simple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP) allows your email client to send your email messages to your email server. It's also the protocol responsible for sending your message to the mailbox of your recipient email server. Why should I use IMAP and not POP3? Based on the definition above, we recommend using IMAP because it allows you to sync your email messages across all devices where you have your email configured. Since POP3 doesn't store emails on the server, there are cases when you think you've lost your email when in fact, it was downloaded on another device earlier. How do I set up IMAP and SMTP? Make sure that you can log in to your MyStrikingly Email account first before you set up your email client. Click on one of the links below to check the step-by-step guide for your email clients : Windows Mail (Windows 8/8.1) Windows Mail (Windows 10) Android Phone iPhone Gmail Thunderbird Other Email Clients If your email client isn't listed, use the table below to add your email client.

    "text": "Setting Up Shipping for Simple Store\n\nAll Simple Store sellers can set up a flat shipping rate to apply to orders during checkout. You can also set up flat shipping rates for different regions. Learn how you can add and manage shipping options in our short guide below: About Flat Rate Shipping We currently offer one shipping option in Simple Store - Flat Rate Shipping. Flat Rate Shipping is a standard rate charged regardless of a package’s weight or size. You charge one standard shipping fee per order or per item. It’s ideal for most businesses that want a simple shipping setup that’s easy to understand for your customers. Getting Started To get started, get into your Simple Store manager and select the SHIPPING tab. All sellers have the option to set a base shipping fee per order and an additional item fee for each additional item purchased. For example, if the shipping fee for the order (or first item) is $5 and the shipping fee per additional item is $2, the shipping cost for a customer ordering 4 items is $11 ($5 + $2 + $2 + $2). Shipping Options You can also set different flat shipping rates for different regions. First, add a country or region you’re shipping to by clicking “ADD REGION” button. For each country or region you’ve added, enter the fee for the first item and for each additional item (optional). You can add up to 20 regions to ship to. Note: Setting up regions will restrict shipping to only the regions or countries you’ve added. Example #1: You want to set a domestic shipping fee as well as a fee for orders to the rest of the world, add the rates for the US, and select “Rest of the World” as your additional region. You can also set up different shipping rates for overlapping regions. For example, if you’re a seller in France, you can set a domestic shipping rate, a rate for orders sent to Spain, and then set a rate for Europe. Customers from France, Spain, or from the rest of Europe will only see the shipping rate that applies to the shipping address they’ve entered. After setting up your shipping options, you need to add a \"Shipping Option Name\" and click on [SAVE] button on the bottom to save your changes. Shipping in Checkout Flow In the checkout flow, your customers will only see the countries you set in the shipping settings. Shipping calculations will appear after your customers fill out the shipping address. Note: You can also set up a shipping fee per item weight. We hope that you'll find this feature useful!

    "text": "Strikingly Domain: Verify Your Domain via Email\n\nAs of January 1, 2014, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) created a new rule that requires the domain registration to be validated via email (subject \" VERIFICATION REQUIRED - Please verify your domain name(s) as soon as possible \") for the following situations: a new domain is purchased/registered domain contact information is changed (name, email) a domain is transferred to a new registrar These rules were made for security reasons. This is to prevent domain hi-jacking/domain theft--the change in domain registration without the permission of the original owner of the domain. Here's more about the new ICANN policy . FAQ 1. Why isn't my domain working? It used to work. 2. I received an email with the subject \"VERIFICATION REQUIRED - Please verify your domain name(s) as soon as possible\". What is this email for? 3. I got a verification email, but I deleted it. Will I still get another email? 4. Why I didn't receive the domain verification email? 5. My domain is suspended, showing unverified, What should I do now? 1. Why isn't my domain working? It used to work. If you have recently purchased a domain and did not respond to the Domain verification email (see below), chances are, your domain has been suspended for being unverified. 2. I received an email with the subject \"VERIFICATION REQUIRED - Please verify your domain name(s) as soon as possible\". What is this email for? The verification email is sent to you when you register a domain name with Strikingly. This email contains a link that takes you to a page that displays the first and last name and the email address you used when you registered the domain. You need to click on the link to confirm. Confirming will prevent your site from going down after 15 days. Note: Domain registrant verification only applies to gTLDs (generic top-level domains) such as .com, .net, .org, and does not apply to ccTLDs (country code top-level domains) like .co and .me. 3. I got a verification email, but I deleted it. Will I still get another email? Strikingly sends out emails to you within the 15-day period. If you haven't verified or didn't receive it, you may contact us through support@strikingly.com and we'll resend the verification email. Alternatively, you may let us know which alternate email you'd like to use to receive the verification email and we'll resend the email from our end! Here's a timeline of when verification emails are sent: Image Credits: OpenSRS 4. Why didn't I receive the domain verification email? Try to check your spam or bulk folders! Nothing in spam? If you use @mac.com/@icloud.com or @me.com addresses, we encourage you to Whitelist / Add a Safe Sender of @registrarmail.net, with the IP address of 64.99.180.0/24. You can do this within the Apple Email/iCloud Interface. This issue is originating at Apple's server, and we wouldn't be able to fix this issue on our end. As an alternative (if you're using an Apple address), we can change your email to a different address (Gmail, Hotmail, etc.). Once we change your email address, it will toggle the system to automatically send another verification email to your new email. Contact us through email or through chat ! 5. My domain is suspended, showing unverified, what should I do now? Your domain would be restored once you've gone through the domain verification by clicking the link in the verification email, and after you confirm your email address. To resend the verification email to your inbox, contact us via email at support@strikingly.com or through chat !",

Flat discount A flat discount is a set monetary amount of a price. You can set a flat discount for: Any orders (excluding shipping) Orders over fixed amount (excluding shipping) c. Free shipping discount A free shipping discount overrides the shipping costs of an order. You can set free shipping discounts for any order or orders over a fixed price. 5. For \"For all orders\" & \"For orders over\", you can enter the maximum number of uses for the discount. This limit applies to the overall usage of the discount, and not to the maximum number of times an individual customer can apply it. For \"Specific products\" & \"Specific categories\", you can also enter the \"Product Quantity Limit Per Order\" for the discount. This is to limit the number of items this discount can apply to in a single order. If this coupon applies to multiple items with different prices, the highest-price items will be discounted first. Note: Currently, it is not possible to set a coupon for single use only. 6. After you fill out all information for a coupon, click on the “Save” button at the bottom right to launch your coupon! Coupon Management Once you’ve set up your coupon codes, you can manage them in your \"Coupon Dashboard\". You’ll be able to delete the coupon or reactivate your coupon after it expires by setting a new expiration date. However, you won’t be able to change the coupon code or coupon offer once a coupon has been created. Once orders start coming in, you’ll be able to view how many times a coupon has been used in your coupon dashboard. You can add up to 100 coupons for your Simple Store. Coupons in the Checkout Process Your customers will see the discount applied immediately after entering the coupon code during the checkout process. The percentage-based and flat discounts will be applied pre-shipping to your customer's entire order. The free shipping discount will be shown after your customers enter their shipping addresses. Buyers will not be able to stack discounts, only one discount can be redeemed per order. The free shipping discount will be shown after your customers enter a shipping address. Setting the Product Quantity Limit Per Order You can set a limit to the number of items to which a discount code can be applied. This is available on a percentage-based discount for specific products. Here's an example: You're selling shirts at $10 each and you'd want the coupon code set to 15% and limited to three shirts per purchase. Buyer 1 buys 10 shirts. The total will be computed as (3 shirts x $10 x 15%) + (7 shirts x $10). Buyer 2 buys 3 shirts and applies the discount. The total will be computed as (3 shirts x $10 x 15%). If you set the \"Product Quantity Limit Per Order\" to \"Unlimited\", then regardless of how many are purchased, the discount applies to all of the purchases. However, if you have different variations per product, purchases will be discounted per product and not per variation. Say, you have red shirts, blue shirts, and green shirts. Setting the Product Quantity Limit Per Order to Unlimited with a 50% discount. Buyer 1 gets 10 red shirts, and 5 green shirts and uses the discount, that’s (15 shirts x $10 x 50%). Promoting discounts You can distribute your coupon codes to your customers through email, or share your coupon code on social media. You can also promote your offer on your site to allow all visitors to use it. If you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us .",

Not all sections of your page can include a background image or video - this is to keep sections clean, balanced, and easy to read. Will the videos play on mobile devices? Video backgrounds will not play on mobile (phones and tablets) because different OS developers intentionally disabled autoplay on mobile devices to protect users’ bandwidth. Instead, the video's thumbnail (the one shown on YouTube and Vimeo previews) will be shown in the background. To learn how you can change your video thumbnail, you can check these guides: YouTube: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72431?hl=en Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/help/faq/managing-your-videos/video-settings#how-do-i-change-the-thumbnail-of-my-video Why does my video show up with a dark filter?

But this also means it usually takes 5 - 15 minutes for new content to propagate to all servers, depending on various factors such as server status, network congestion, etc. To verify that your changes are properly published, you can modify your URL so that it will bypass the CDN temporarily. Here is how you can do it. Suppose you have just published your site and your site URL is http://mysite.mystrikingly.com, but you find that your latest change is not refreshed, you can add a ?v=new to the end of your URL: http://mysite.strikingly.com/?v=new This will bypass the CDN and you should now be able to see your latest change. Similarly, if your site has a custom domain http://www.mysite.com, you can visit: http://www.mysite.com/?v=new Once you have verified that your site is updated, it's just a matter of time for the content to propagate to all CDN servers.

    "text": "Email Notifications for Simple Store\n\nWe want to simplify customer communications so we set up a series of automatic email notifications to your customer after he/she places an order. Email Notifications When customers submit an order, they'll receive an automatic confirmation email. They'll also receive a notification email when you ship their order or issue a refund. You’ll receive email notifications when a new order comes in or when your stock is running low. Note: Emails that are sent from our platform but labeled with a free email address (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, Proton, etc) are more likely to be marked as spam or junk. Instead, we recommend using a custom domain email for \"From Email.\". If you already have a domain with us, check this guide to purchase your custom email . In case you have a custom email from a different platform, you'll need to authenticate it by following the steps in this guide . Email notifications sent to you: Order Placed - Sent when a new order is placed Out of Stock - Sent when product is out of stock Email notifications sent to your customers: Order Confirmed - Sent automatically after purchase Order Completed - Sent automatically when an order is marked as completed Order Refunded - Sent automatically when a refund is issued You can preview what each email looks like by going to your Settings > Email Notification > Email Templates: Here's a sample preview: Note: Besides English, we also support French, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese translations for emails. Find out how here, in our language guide . You can’t disable email notifications in this panel. But, you can customize the \" Order Completed\" email by adding a note to your customers when completing an order. The notes you add will be included in the Order Completed notification that's sent to your customer. Edit Email Templates for Order notifications If you'd like to set a certain tone in the order notifications for branding consideration, or you'd like to send instant download links, you can do it through the \" Email templates \" (for Pro/VIP). Email templates can be customized by following these steps: In your Settings, go to Email Notifications > Show advanced options > Email Templates and click \" Edit \" on any of the order notifications. Edit the subject and the message body. Don't forget to hit \"Save\" when you're done! Sample edited template: Notes: The subject and message body can be modified. However, the order details cannot be edited. If you'd like to go back to the original template, you can do so by clicking \" Restore defaults \", then \" Save \".

    "text": "Background Sizes & Settings - Guidelines for background images\n\nHere are some tips on how to make your big background images more striking! What size should my background images be? Strikingly's background images are meant to fill a wide variety of screen sizes, from monitor to tablet to phone. We recommend a size of 1600 pixels wide by 900 pixels tall, so your background can look great on all devices. Be careful about including non-background images of people, logos, and other content! Check how these look with our \"preview\" function. What background setting should I use? There are a few options to size/align your background: Stretch is the default. This setting will stretch your image, so it covers the entire screen in both height and width. This is usually the best option because the image will act as a background on any screen size. However, if you have content on the sides of your image (particularly the left and right), it may not show on mobile phones. Contain will ensure that the entire image is visible without being cropped, but it may result in some blank space around the image on certain devices. Center means the image will be displayed in the middle of the section and will not be resized. However, if the image is too small, the background will show white space on the edges. If the image is too big, some parts may be cut off, especially on smaller screens. Tile will center the image and then repeat it, which is useful for patterns. Where can I get good background images? Various search engines are a great place to find background images that suit you. Search for \"_______ desktop backgrounds\" and see what you find. Remember to check image rights and do not use stock images you do not have the right to! Inspiring visuals to use: https://www.vecteezy.com/ Beautiful copyright-free images: http://gratisography.com/ You can use Strikingly's Icon/Background Library to find great images for your site. Go to \"Upload\" on any image and look at the tabs up top! Can I use image effects on my background images? Use effects in the photo editor to completely change the look of your images. Click on the image after you've uploaded it, and then choose \"Image Editor\". Try the \"filters\" and mirroring the image to see what complements your site. See what else you can do! Note: For image sizing specifications, please check out our guidelines here . In case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.",

    "text": "Link to Specific Section\n\nCan I link a specific section of my site? Where do my links go? Yes! Click this link: http://www.strikingly.com/pro#styles-colors You'll notice it automatically goes to the 7th section titled \"Style your site\" on the page. Note: These used to appear automatically in the address bar when scrolling, but we have disabled them because they affect other parts of the site. How do I link a specific section by name? Go to your site editor. Figure out the section's name from the left panel. Converting it, punctuation is ignored and hyphens are added, such as the \"Who are we?\" section becomes \"who-are-we\". Add it to your link. If you have a custom domain, add #who-are-we, after your domain. For example, yourdomain.com/#section-name. If you have no domain connected, then it will be http://page.mystrikingly.com/#section-name. Send that link to friends -- this is a good way to let users \"jump\" down to a later section on your page. How do I link a specific section by number? You can also link to a section by its number! Just use http://www.yourdomain.com/#2 to go to the second section, or http://page.mystrikingly.com/#2 if you don't have a domain connected. Notes: Be careful! You do not need the \"s/pages/\" or \"/edit\" part in your link -- if you have this, it's because you are looking at the site inside the editor, rather than the live site. If you are linking to a section on the SAME PAGE, you can simply put the latter part (just \"#2\" or \"#section-name\" in the \"URL:\" box when linking text or images! Linking to Specific Sections in a Multipage Site If you want to add links to different sections in your site's navigation menu, go into your page manager and add an external link. Click on the setting gear and select the option to link to [Page & Sections] from the external link menu dropdown. Select the page and section you want to link to and drag the external link to where you'd like it to show in your site's navigation menu. Have some questions?

To speed up this process you can Verifying Google Search Console and Submitting Sitemap or request a re-index using Google Search Console. Search engines cut off descriptions around 160 characters. Tips for Good Meta Descriptions A good meta description is short, to-the-point, and tells the searcher what they'll get when they land on your site, and an accurate meta description can help improve your clickthrough. For example: Johnny's Bakery is a gourmet bakery and confectionery based in the Mission in San Francisco. We started in 1965 and we've been offering delightful bread, cakes, pies, and cookies to happy customers ever since! If you don't write any meta description, Google will automatically generate the snippet for you, but it might not be what you want to be displayed to searchers.

It usually takes 30 minutes to take effect. Once it's off, click the \" Advanced DNS \" tab. Step 4: Clean up your DNS records In DNS template section, select “ Choose DNS template ” to show all records. Look for any CNAME record named www and delete it. Look for any A records named “@” and delete them. Step 5: Add a CNAME record Scroll down and look for \" ADD NEW RECORD\" button. Select \" CNAME Record\" as the record type. Copy the relevant information from Strikingly and paste it into the corresponding places, as shown in the image below. Click on the check button to save the changes. Step 6: Add an A record Scroll down and look for \" ADD NEW RECORD\" button. Select \" A Record\" as the record type. Copy the relevant information from Strikingly and paste it into the corresponding places, as shown in the image below. Click on the check button to save the changes. Step 7: Confirm your setup is complete After you’ve confirmed the above setup, go back to your Strikingly site editor and click the \" I've fixed, check again \" button in the pop-up. If you've configured your DNS settings correctly, the pop-up will close and the domain status will show as \" CONNECTED \". If you haven't configured your DNS correctly, the popup will display the error status, and you should go back to step 3 to configure the DNS records correctly.

    "text": "Create Multi-Language Site\n\nHow can I create a multi-language site? Strikingly allows you to easily link together multiple sites to create a multi-language site. For example, let's say you've created a site in English and published it at www.myexamplesite.com . To turn this into a multi-language site (e.g. English and Japanese), you can do the following: 1. Activate the Language Switcher in either site’s Settings > Advanced > Multi-language. 2. After activating, you can add multi-language versions of the current site. You can set a language label and a flag icon for each site. 3. Click “ Add New Language ” and select the language you’d like to add. 4. Select how you’d like to add the new language site. There are 3 different ways you can do this: Option 1: Connecting an existing site URL You can directly connect to another site if you have already created a site in the target language. The site can be a Strikingly site or a non-Strikingly site. Option 2: Clone the current site & manually translate If you do not have a created foreign site, don’t worry we’ve got you covered! You can select the second option - your current site will be cloned and you need to manually translate the new site afterward. Option 3: Clone the current site & auto-translate Note: this is a VIP feature. We’ve adopted Google Translate to help you create a multi-language site within minutes. You’ll need to select the site sections you wish to be auto-translated. Once you confirm, your site will be cloned first, and then its content will be automatically translated. You’ll need to review and publish the newly-created site before it becomes visible to your site visitors. Note: You can edit other parts of your current site during the cloning. We will notify you once the cloning process is complete. What are the available languages for the multi-language site option? Our Language Switcher supports all languages, and you can choose from the list of default languages provided. If the language you need isn't available, select \"Other\", then enter the language name and proceed to translate the site manually. This way, you can create a multi-language site tailored to your needs. What content does auto-translation cover? Page sections content (selected and required by default) Site Menu Text Button text Store and Portfolio (optional) Blogs (optional) SEO-related content: including page URLs, titles, meta descriptions & image alt texts (optional) 5. Once you save these settings and publish your site , both sites will show a language switcher dropdown menu with flags! This dropdown menu links the two sites to each other, so your visitor can always switch the language as needed. Note: This Language Switcher applies to all associated sites simultaneously. Once you apply the settings to one site, it automatically applies the same settings to all sites in the Language Switcher list, so the sites are all synced. Note : If you have a custom domain, you can connect the new language site to a subdomain, such as fr.myexamplesite.com. (If you've purchased your domain on Strikingly, you can read this guide to set up subdomains.) Email support@strikingly.com or chat with us if you have any questions!",

Let's try to fix it! \"Problem Occurred While Saving Your Page\" 1. Do you have your site editor opened in different tabs or browsers? Are there two people editing your site at the same time? If you do, I'd recommend closing the other tabs/browsers. Having your editor open in two or more windows can cause conflict in the system since we also auto-save. It could prevent the system from saving the right version. 2. Is your internet connection working properly? An intermittent connection can cause this error. You may not immediately notice it, but sometimes, your internet connection \"skips\" and if that happens, your connection with our servers is lost--resulting in this error. 3. Have you tried using a different browser/computer or incognito window to edit your site? It may be a browser issue. If you have several extensions installed on your browser, this may affect your site editor, so we'd recommend trying it out on a different browser or computer or using incognito/private browsing mode.

    "text": "Optimize Blog Posts for Search Engines\n\nBlogging is a great way to increase your website’s visibility. Focus on creating valuable, information-rich content that your readers will find useful, rather than posts stuffed with keywords. The keys to improving your search engine rankings are quality and relevance. The four factors that correlate with higher-quality content are: Longform content (holistic and relevant) Media-rich content (images and videos) Easy-to-read content Semantically comprehensive content Besides the quality of the content itself, Strikingly’s Simple blog has a handful of ways that can clue search engines into the “relevancy” of your blog post to the subject you’re writing about. Titles/Headings and subheadings The titles/headings and subheadings in your blog posts are automatically formatted as H1 or H2 tags, respectively. The H title tags have long been important to search engines as indicators of what a page of content is about. Permalinks Permalinks are the permanent URLs to your blog posts. Including the “keyword” you’re writing your article around in the URL is another way to demonstrate to search engines that your post is relevant to the subject your blog is about. In the Simple Blog, the permalink for your blog is synced with the title of your blog. For example, if your blog post title is “10 Ways To Improve Your Writing”, the link to your blog post will be “yourwebsiteurl.com/blog/10-ways-to-improve-your-writing”. To help your blog post rank higher on search engines, make sure your title is descriptive of what you’re writing about. Or you can opt to customize the permalink if you'd like to use other keywords that are relevant to the subject. Image Alt Tags Image Alt tags/texts are a way for search engines to understand what an image is. To write an alt tag for the image in your blog post, click on the image, and you’ll see a text box to place “Alt Text” into. Write a short description of what the image is. For example, for the image above, I can write “Light breakfast idea #1: Coffee and Bread”. Meta description A meta description is the snippet of information below the link of a search result. Its purpose is to describe the contents of the page to search engines and your potential audience. You can think of the meta description as a way to entice readers who are searching online for information to click on your post. To write your meta description, click on your blog post settings. The description should be a short and catchy summary of what your post is about. Social Sharing To search engines, the number of social shares that a blog post receives is an indication of the quality of the blog post. Be sure to enable the social media feature at the bottom of your posts. In case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.",

    "text": "Adding Keywords (Search Phrases) for SEO\n\nKeywords (or phrases) are the words users enter into search engines to find relevant content. To rank well in search results, it's important to use keywords in your content correctly. Tips for Good Keywords Use keywords the visitors would use, or you want search engines to relate to your site. Do not use irrelevant keywords or keyword stuffing. They won't help your site's ranking and might actually hurt you. Try to use descriptive, specific, and unique phrases. Make sure the content is also useful and easy to navigate for visitors. Try to add keywords in these places to improve the search engine optimization (SEO) for your website: Site domain (if you don't have a domain yet, you can purchase from us ) URL page slugs Site/page title Headings Meta descriptions (Meta tags) Image ALT tags Page's body content FAQ Can I add meta keywords tag? No, because the site meta keywords tag is an outdated option that’s useless for SEO, and in some cases can even hurt your search engine ranking. Search engines, including Google, award higher rankings to websites that have: relevant, reputable, and high-quality content; high user satisfaction; popular pages. In this scenario, meta keywords do not noticeably influence SEO rankings anymore. In fact, if meta tags are abused (keyword stuffing), your websites can suffer from search engines’ punitive quality algorithm. Keyword stuffing is an old SEO practice where a webmaster adds a lot of irrelevant keywords on websites in order to jack up their site rank in the search results. This makes the site spammy and does not give relevant results to searchers. All search engines now ignore keywords in their ranking algorithm, and some search engines even punish this by decreasing your ranking. How long does it take for keywords to work? Adding keywords does not guarantee automatic updates or add the keywords in search results or affect your search engine ranking. It is determined by search engines and many factors, like quality, authority, etc. To speed up this process, you can: 1. Verifying Google Search Console and Submitting Sitemap or request a re-index using Google Search Console. 2. F ocus on quality content. Adding useful and relevant content is the best way to get those “organic” visits. Search engines will not rank your content unless it helps somebody. 3. Do keyword research and create content. You can use tools like Semrush , and Keywords Everywhere to create content or better, blog posts .

The first time you hit publish, we make your site visible to the world via search. If you don’t want to be visible, go to Settings > Advanced > Privacy & Legal to hide the site from Google. While in the editor: Site Basics -Did you change the title of your site? This shows up on your viewer’s browser tab and is the default text if they bookmark you. Change this in Settings > Basic Info (and check out the other settings). -Did you change the Strikingly URL so you can share it easily or connect to a custom domain such as yourname.com? Also on Settings, you can do it through the Domains tab. Learn more about connecting a domain . -Are you using the font you want to use? Press the “Style” button in the upper left panel > go to Fonts to make changes. You can change colors here as well. -Did you add titles and descriptions to the images, or make sure to empty the boxes when you didn’t want to? -Scroll to the footer. Look at the social media links by clicking on them. By default, they will use the URL/custom domain of your page. You can change this to your Facebook entity page or something else by changing the links there! Check if they contain any extra spaces inside the text box. Menu and Links -Each template’s menu is a little different. Some have it at the top, others on the side, and some templates have no navigation menu. Feel free to choose what navigation layout works for you by switching templates through Styles. -Scroll through your page to see if this is a logical order for sections to proceed. If not, reorder them with the menu on the left, by clicking and dragging the sandwich icon (the button with 3 horizontal lines). -Look at the names of the sections on the left-hand side to see if they are meaningful. (Sections are the chunks of the site you created with the “Add New Section\" button.) Remember that these are also what shows on your URLs, and you can link them directly. Learn more here . -Check the menu (if you have one) and see if the right items are showing. Is there a reason for someone to click on a menu item or to know they’re on that item? You can click the gear icon inline with the section name on the left panel > check/uncheck the \"Show in Navigation\" option: -Do you want to link to an external webpage through the menu, such as a blog, a partner, or a website? If so, you can achieve it through the left panel. You can set external links below your section list by clicking \"Add new link\" under Advanced. Spacing -Look at your text boxes. Do they contain extra spaces on the top, bottom, or inside the text box? Did you press enter at strategic points in the paragraph so that you could space it out perfectly? Try not to do that, as it will not appear the same on mobile. -Did you “remove” all the images you don’t want and “empty” all the text boxes you don’t need? Empty text boxes and empty images will collapse on your live site. While in preview/live: Uniqueness -Look at your copywriting. Is it bold and concise? Is it striking? -Look at all of the images. Are there any within the same section that could be cropped to a different size? Do they need some image effects? Hover over the image > click Edit > go to the image editor to change how it looks. -Are you using any of our stock images? Remember that other people may also be using these images, so you may want to use the image editor to make them look a little different, or upload your own. We’ll get more images over time as well. Functionality -Scroll through your site and click all of the links. Do they work? Are there some things you forgot to link? Link them in the editor by hovering over the image > click Edit > click Add link. Learn more here . -Did you use the mailto: and tel: links so users can email or call you when appropriate? Learn more here . -Click the tablet and mobile buttons when checking the preview to see how your site looks on mobile ! The usual suspects are: 1. Background images . Check your settings — “Stretch” usually works best as this covers the full background area, but you can use “Contain” if you want the whole image to show. We also have other options you can find by clicking \"Background\" in the upper right corner of the section. For more details about the recommended background image sizes, check this article. 2. Content in background images . If you have a logo, text, or other main content in your background, consider using a different section — Big media, so that the full image always shows, or one with an image on a background, so you can upload the logo and background separately. If it’s text, use a section with text and a background image if possible! Search engine friendliness: -Did you add your site to your email signature?

    "text": "Publish Website\n\nHow do I publish my website? When you're done editing your site, you can publish it by going to your site editor and clicking the Publish button. This will make your site live, which means: 1. It can be viewed by anyone who knows your site URL. 2. Search engines will start indexing (listing) your site in their search results. How does the publish button work? Before you click the publish button for the first time, no one can find/stumble upon your site because it is hidden from all search engines! If you go to your strikingly URL, it will have the message \"This site is not yet published.\" After you click \"Publish\" for the first time, your site will be indexable (findable) by search engines. You can disable this in Settings > Show Advanced > Privacy & Legal: What is the difference between the saved version and the live version? Any changes you make in the editor are automatically saved. You also have the option to save manually by clicking on the \"Save now\" link located at the top of the left panel. These changes are viewed through the \"Preview site\" button on the left panel: The Live version is only updated when you click \"Publish.\" If you have a custom domain, there might be a delay (between 5-15 minutes) before your live site is updated, but you can still view your site from the \"Preview\" button. This is because we are pushing your changes to our CDN which allows your site to be online and load fast anywhere in the world. How do I hide my site after publishing? 1. Pro users: Add a password to your site. This will allow only people with the password to see the content. This will also block the content from Google until you remove the password. Go to Settings > Show Advanced > Privacy & Legal to set this up. 2. All users: Click the \"Unpublish\" button. Go to your Dashboard > look for the site you want to unpublish > click the gear icon under the site name > select \" Unpublish \". Check out the visual tutorial here! 3. All users: Clone your site. Note: This is a little complex. By following the steps above, you can unpublish your site and it will make your old link invalid. You can then start again with a new, unpublished site. When people find the old link, they will not be able to view any content. However, this method means that Google will still see the description you wrote in the site's Settings for a couple more days. Now, to clone your site, go back to your main Dashboard at strikingly.com > click the gear icon under the site name > select \" Clone \". The new site created is automatically brand new and has never been published. Then, go back and delete the old site or rename it to invalidate the URL. Note: Changes made to your website are saved automatically. In case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us .",

You can use the HTML section to do a variety of things, from including a Twitter or Facebook feed, an online store, a blog RSS, feed, or embedding another site! What the \"Show in iFrame\" checkbox does is essentially put the code you pasted/wrote in its own little \"window\" so that it can be sure to be visible and not affect any of the other code on the page. As a general rule: Mainstream HTML embeds (Twitter, Facebook) do not need the box checked. Any code you wrote that has all of the proper closing tags, such as </example> does not need the box checked. Any code that shows another website directly on your Strikingly site may need the box checked. Sometimes, it's necessary to check this box in order for the page or section to work at all! \"Show in iFrame\" affects mobile compatibility. Since using an iframe is a little like looking at the content through a window, the user's computer is not interacting with that content directly and doesn't always know how to respond to it. More on why sites may not be showing correctly on mobile. Use the \"Preview\" button to see your section live and on different devices or screen sizes.

The HTML section is a Pro feature that enables multiple integrations with various apps and even allows the execution of custom applications that you can write yourself (using HTML code). How to add the custom code section: Go to your site editor and click \"Add New Section\" in the left panel. Select the \"Embed and HTML\" section from the section list. Once it has been added, go to the section and click it to edit. From the app list, select \"HTML.\" Copy and paste the HTML embed code in the field and hit \"Save\". Here are a few things that you can do: Add HTML embed codes for several applications not included in our App Store. Create custom buttons, text sections, images, video galleries, etc. (You can ask someone to write the code for you if you don't know how to). When copying embed codes from sources, copy EVERYTHING! Codes are pretty sensitive and a missing or misplaced period or other punctuation/letter/character can cause your code not to work. If you've set your eye on a specific app and want to integrate it into your Strikingly site, look for its HTML/embed code. Contact your app's support people and ask them to help you find it. If they're not useful, contact us ! We love to find ways to help! The HTML embed section is exclusive to apps that are displayed within your webpage .

    "text": "Improving Your Site Page Load Speed\n\nSite load speed is a measurement of how fast the content on your page fully loads. Many factors can affect the loading time of a page. Here are some ways to improve your site speed. Use the latest and supported browser Check if your browser is the latest version. Strikingly supports the browser versions listed in this guide . Optimize your home page/ landing page It's said most visitors will leave if it takes time to load the homepage. Make sure to display only relevant, useful, simple content to attract your visitors to explore the rest of the pages. We recommend using fewer media, such as images, and videos on your homepage. Excessive information can be overwhelming, and the visitors may click away. Keep your content lightweight We recommend no more than 5 sections on one page. If your page has more than 5 sections or one topic, distribute them across your new pages . Use \"Read more\", \"Check out my portfolio\" or \"Watch more videos\" to encourage site visitors to explore your site's content. This keeps your homepage clean and organized, also it's easier for your visitors to find the information they need. Reduce image size Strikingly automatically reduce the size of images uploaded. However, if you have lots of images, it will make the site slow, especially on mobile devices and slower connections. JPEG is recommended because JPEG images are 80% smaller and have almost the same quality. If your image needs a transparent background, use PNG. PNG files are best used for icons and logos. GIF is good for showcasing animated content, but it must be fully downloaded before they begin to play. We recommend converting it into a video with better quality and smaller sizes. Reduce the number of videos Add videos like YouTube or Vimeo, including background videos, can take a longer time to load, especially on mobile devices. It's best not to have more than one video on one page. If you have more than one video, you can add video links to text, buttons, etc. For example, you can put one video and add a \"See All Videos\" button that links to a separate page with all the videos or your videos channel. Use special effects wisely Special effects such as Text + Button Slider , Banner Image Slider , or animation can enhance the visual appeal of your site. However, they can affect your page loading speed and impact your SEO. We recommend having 2–3 slides in one slider section, and not having more than one slider section on your page. Minimize custom code or third-party apps Custom code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) or third-party embedded code can cause your site to load slowly. We recommend not putting them on your home page or adding links to a button, text, or image on the homepage that will navigate your visitors to them. Avoid custom font Custom fonts for headings are fine, try not to use custom fonts everywhere. Because if you use a font that does not exist on your visitor's device, then the font has to be downloaded first. It will take time to load the text. Clear browsing history & cache When the site has been opened on the browser the first time, it will create a small image of the site, so it will be faster to pull up when you revisit the site. However, caches might also be the cause of why sites load slowly, especially when there are few published edits. This is because the browser would read that the small image it created before conflicts with the changes to the site. You may try using private mode or use a different browser. Check for other causes There could be more factors that can affect your site load speed. This includes: Third-party domain configuration Device's memory and capacity Local network firewalls Anti-virus software Browser extensions You may try using private mode or a different browser, disabling anti-virus software, switching to another network, restarting your router, etc. In case you need assistance, shoot us a line at support@strikingly.com or chat with us .",

    "text": "Understanding PageSpeed Insights and W3C Compliance\n\nPageSpeed Insights PageSpeed Insights (PSI) is a tool from Google that tests your site's performance on both desktop and mobile devices. Keep in mind that, as per Google’s definition: “These rules are general front-end best practices you can apply at any stage of web development”. In this sense, the score that you get from Google’s PageSpeed test does not tell you how fast your site actually loads, but how your site fares based on Web Optimization rules that advance the rendering and execution of front-end codes (HTML, CSS, etc). However, many of these rules are rather outdated for modern websites. If you run the test against major websites like Facebook , Microsoft , and Yahoo , you will get equally low scores. One useful recommendation from Google PageSpeed is the\"Optimize Image\" section. These are often a major cause of slow websites. Compressing your images before uploading may improve your PageSpeed. Check out these image compression services and see what works for you: Tiny PNG Smush.it Photoshop and/or other photo editing software We also constantly update our site rendering technology to improve speed when testing with Google PageSpeed Insights. The majority of Strikingly sites now score over 90% on the Google PageSpeed test. Note: You may have to run the test a few times to see improved scores! This forces the site to be recached, which improves load times around the world. If you add any third-party scripts or custom code, that may take extra time to load and run, and this may decrease your PageSpeed score. Visit more tips for Improving Your Site Page Load Speed . W3C Compliance Full compliance with W3C is not a strict requirement to make your website SEO-compliant. W3C compliance simply implies that the HTML and CSS code that your website built is compliant with the standards set by the W3C. There are several modern, advanced website rendering techniques used by Strikingly that the validator doesn’t understand, like lazy loading. It’s possible that if you load your site on W3C validators, it will tag lazy loading JavaScript as an error. If you want your site to rank high in SEO, make sure that your site is regularly updated, has high-quality and relevant content, and gets quality backlinks by sharing and distributing your site.

    "text": "Create/Activate Multi-Page Site\n\nA multi-page site is a different way for you to showcase your content and add visitor interactions to your site. Check out our example of a multiple-page site here . Everyone can now use this feature. Our Free and Limited plan users can add up to 5 pages, while our Pro and VIP plan users can take advantage of up to 100 pages. Here's how you can create a multiple-page site Strikingly! Before You Begin If your site is live, we recommend cloning your main/homepage site first and working off the copy to prevent changes affecting your site visitors. To clone your site, click the gear and select \"CLONE\": Note: Cloning your site will not transfer your form data, Simple Blog posts, or Simple Store data. About Multiple Pages You can add up to 100 pages on your multiple-page site (for Pro and VIP plan users). Your section-level navigation menu will be replaced with a page-level navigation menu You can’t use different templates for different pages on your multiple-page site - this is to maintain design consistency throughout the pages on your site We currently allow for one social feed Step 1: Activating Multiple Pages Go into the editor and click \"Add Another Page\" from the left panel. Confirm the action by clicking on \"Activate Multiple Page\". Step 2: Adding Pages After you’ve activated the multiple page mode, you’ll see a new drop-down option where \"Manage Pages\" is nested under and \"MANAGE\" above the page drop-down. Both options will take you to the page manager, where you can manage, add, delete, and hide your pages. Click either [Manage Pages] or [MANAGE] to add pages. Select the option to [Add New Page], rename your new page, and repeat until you’ve added all your new pages to the site. You can always return to the Page Manager to rename, reorder, add, or delete pages. Once you’ve set up your pages, click [Back to site design] to add content to your new pages. Note: The character limit for a page name is set to 31 characters . This is to ensure compatibility and readability across various devices, particularly within the navigation bar . Longer names can sometimes lead to formatting issues or may not display correctly on certain screens. Also, shorter names are often more user-friendly and easier to remember. Step 3: Adding Content to New Pages Now that you’re back in the section editor, start adding content and moving sections around each page. To add new sections to a page, click the Page Selector to choose which page you want to add content to. And then, add or delete sections in the left panel as you would normally. How do I move a section to another/new page? You can easily move sections around from page to page on your multiple-page site. Go to the section you’d like to move around and click the gear icon beside the section title and click \"Move to page\". Select the page you want to move the section to, and violà! Step 4: Setting Up Domain and Linking for Your Multiple-Page Site Setting Up Page Domains: We automatically generate domain paths (or URLs) from each page title for you. For example, if your domain is http://sunnysideup.mystrikingly.com , and then your page titled “About Us” will have the URL http://sunnysideup.mystrikingly.com/about-us . The same goes for each of the pages you’ve added to your multiple-page site - the links are automatically created for all your pages. Linking to Sections and Pages: If you want to link to a specific page of your site - the link will look like this: www.yourdomain.com/the-page-title For example, my domain is http//:sunnysideup.mystrikingly.com, and the page I want to link to is “Eggnog Blog”. My URL will be: http://sunnysideup.mystrikingly.com/eggnog-blog If you want to create a link to a specific section on a specific page, this is the link structure: www.yourdomain.com/your-page-title/#2 For example, I want to link to the second section on the SSUP Seoul page, and this is what my link will look like: http://sunnysideup.mystrikingly.com/ssup-seoul/#2 Step 5: Reverting Back to a Single Page If at any point you find yourself missing your old one-pager - just go back into your site [SETTINGS] > [Advanced] > [MULTIPLE PAGES] and click the “Revert to single page” button. When you revert your page, we'll hide all the pages, only leaving the content on your home page. But don't worry, you can always reactive multiple pages to restore all of your sections. Duplicate Pages If you'd like to make a copy of one or more of your existing pages, you can do that by: 1. Clicking \"Manage\" right above your page drop-down on the left panel of your site editor. 2. Then click the gear icon next to the page you want to duplicate. Select \"Duplicate this page\" from the options. 3. Click \"OK\" on the dialog box that says \"Are you sure you wish to duplicate the \"[Page name]\" page? ALL PAGE CONTENT WILL BE DUPLICATED.\" Notes : Duplicated pages cannot be moved from one site to another. If there is a blog or store on a page, cloning the page will duplicate the blog and the store, but not the store or blog contents. Since blog & store sections are ways to show the contents of the blog/store, those sections will be cloned but the contents are the same. Example: The home Page has a Blog section with 5 blog posts: 1. blog post A 2. blog post B 3. blog post C 4. blog post D 5. blog post E If the Home Page is duplicated, the duplicate page will also have a blog section that contains the same blog posts. If you delete blog post A in the duplicate page, then it will be deleted from the original page (Home Page) too. We hope you'll find this feature useful! Please let us know if you have any questions by emailing us at support@strikingly.com or chat with us. We'd love to hear your feedback!",

    "text": "Why Doesn't My Website Show Up On Google?\n\nQuestion: My site has been online for over a month now and it is still not indexed on Google If your website or specific pages or blog posts are not appearing in Google search results, it could be the site or page is very new, or it may be set to block search engines from indexing it. This guide will assist you in troubleshooting why your site or page is not indexed by Google. 1. Check if Google has indexed your site If you have recently published your website/page/posts, it is normal for it to take some time for Google to index it. Typically, it takes 4 days to 4 weeks. In some cases, it may even take up to 6 months, depending on how quickly Google discovers and records the site. To check if your site or page or blog post is actually missing from Google's index, you can do a quick search on Google using the \"site:yourwebsite.com\" query. If it doesn't show up in the search results, then you can move on to the next step. If your site is already indexed, you may want to focus on improving its search engine ranking. Visit Increase Search Engine Ranking (SEO) or Optimize Blog Posts for Search Engines for tips to enhance your website's ranking. Note: Meta tags and site descriptions only help increase the site's ranking on Google . They have nothing to do with whether the site will be indexed by Google or not. They don't help Google find the site. Even without meta tags and site descriptions, Google will still find the user’s site. 2. Ensure your site is not hidden from search engines Go to Settings > Show Advanced > Privacy & Legal , and make sure that the \"Hide from Search Engines\" option is unchecked. 3. Check if there's a password for the site or page or blog post To check if your site has a password, open it in a private browser window. If your site or page has a password, follow these guidelines to remove it: How to remove the password for specific pages? How to remove the password for the website? How to remove the password for a blog post? 4. Check if the site is properly connected. The site may be using masking/masked forwarding, and this can prevent Google’s spiders from crawling. Visit Fix Problems with Masked Forwarding . 5. Check if the site is submitted to Google After adding your site to Google Console , you can Submit Your Sitemap to Google . This may help speed up the indexing process. You can also Ask Google to recrawl your page. Additionally, you can place the URL of your site on another page that is already indexed by Google, which can assist Google in crawling and indexing your site. Frequently Asked Questions How long does it take for Google to index a new website? Typically, it takes anywhere from 4 days to 4 weeks for Google to index a new website. However, in some cases, it may take up to 6 months depending on various factors. Will my free website/page/blog post show up on Google search? Yes, all websites, whether they are paid or free, have the potential to be indexed by Google. However, it may take some time for new websites or content to be discovered and indexed by Google. To increase visibility, focus on optimizing your content with relevant keywords and following SEO best practices. Regularly updating and promoting your website or blog can also help improve its chances of showing up in Google search results. What if my website still doesn't show up on Google after following these steps? If your website continues to have visibility issues on Google, you can read more from Google: Why is my page missing from Google Search? Does sharing my website on social media help Google index it? While sharing your website on social media can attract more visitors and potential backlinks, it indirectly contributes to indexing but does not directly impact Google's indexing process. To ensure proper indexing, focus on implementing effective SEO strategies like creating high-quality content and obtaining authoritative backlinks. What if I changed some of my website content? How can I recrawl my site? Google offers easy ways to request recrawling of your website . Before starting, make sure your page loads correctly without any coding errors. When you're ready to proceed with recrawling, you can choose one of these methods: 1. Use the URL Inspection tool (for a few URLs) To request a crawl of individual URLs, use the URL Inspection tool . You need to be an owner or full user of the Search Console property to request indexing in this tool. Keep in mind that there's a limit for submitting individual URLs, and requesting multiple crawls for the same URL won't speed up the process. 2. Submit a sitemap (for many URLs at once) If you have a lot of URLs, submitting a sitemap is recommended. A sitemap helps Google discover all the pages on your site, which is especially useful if you've recently made changes. It can also include extra information about different language versions, videos, images, or news pages. Learn how to create and submit a sitemap. Note that recrawling doesn't happen immediately and results aren't guaranteed. It usually takes a few days, and sometimes a few weeks, for the process to complete. Recrawling involves Googlebots discovering new or updated pages on your website and incorporating them into its index. In simpler terms, it is the method used to include webpages in Google search results. What's the difference between Crawling and Indexing? Crawling refers to the process of finding pages and links that lead to additional pages. Indexing , on the other hand, involves storing, analyzing, and organizing the content and relationships between these pages. Certain aspects of indexing play a role in guiding the search engine's crawling behavior. Have some questions? Feel free to shoot them at support@strikingly.com or chat with us.",

I connected my domain to my site before November 2017. How do I activate HTTPS / SSL? What if I'm loading HTTP assets using custom code? How does Strikingly provide this service? My SSL certificate expired, what should I do? Still not working? What is HTTPS / SSL and why does it matter? SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) lets visitors access your site over HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), which means the connection between the visitor and your website is encrypted. This gives your site visitors confidence that personal information cannot be viewed by any third party, especially when accepting credit/debit card numbers through your website (e-commerce site). Google favors sites using HTTPS in their search algorithm. Enabling HTTPS improves SEO (search engine optimization) ranking. Read more about it here . Browsers will display a lock icon next to your URL. Chrome: Firefox: Microsoft Edge: Safari: If you don't have a domain yet, you can Buy & Register Your Own Custom Domain . How do I activate HTTPS / SSL on my custom domain? All Strikingly sites come with HTTPS / SSL automatically enabled , at no extra cost! This applies to both free sites and premium sites on a custom domain. [Legacy cases] If you used an old method to connect your custom domain: If you registered your domain from Strikingly.com before April 5, 2018: Please contact support. We'll help you activate HTTPS for your Strikingly domain. If you registered your domain with another registrar, and you connected your domain to Strikingly before November 1, 2017 : You will need to update your domain's host records. Please consult the following instructions. I connected my domain to my site before November 2017. How do I activate HTTPS / SSL? You may be using our old CNAME host which is dns.strikingly.com . To switch your domain to HTTPS, you’ll need to change your domain's DNS settings (also called \"host records\") to use our new host. Here’s how: Domain: yourdomain.com CNAME: www Old value/host: dns.strikingly.com New value/host: www.yourdomain.com.s.strikinglydns.com (Format should be site URL + .s.strikinglydns.com) Note: yourdomain.com is an example and should be changed to your own custom domain. Subdomain: subdomain.yourdomain.com CNAME: subdomain Old value/host: dns.strikingly.com New value/host: subdomain.yourdomain.com.s.strikinglydns.com (Format should be site URL + .s.strikinglydns.com) Note: subdomain.yourdomain.com is an example and should be changed to your own custom subdomain. (For example, if your domain is mysite.com, you will need to change your www CNAME setting from dns.strikingly.com to www.mysite.com.s.strikinglydns.com.) Note: SSL activation could take up to 48 hours to complete. Be sure to clear your browser cache and history before you check again to see if the site already loads on HTTPS. What if I'm loading HTTP assets using custom code? Please keep in mind that if your site is on HTTPS, then all external content must also be on HTTPS for the browser to acknowledge that your site is \"Secure\". This means that if you load any custom scripts, images, or iframes by writing custom code, those URLs must also be using HTTPS. For example, if your site is https:// www.example.com, and you've added this custom code that loads a script using HTTP: <script src=\" http:// www.facebook.com/sdk.js\"> </script> Then your site will not be \"Secure\". To fix this, you must use the HTTPS version of the script instead, like this: <script src=\" https:// www.facebook.com/sdk.js\"> </script> How does Strikingly provide this service? In the past, installing HTTPS and SSL was a huge pain -- you'd have to purchase an SSL certificate and figure out how to install it on your server. This certificate might cost hundreds of dollars per year. Securing your website should not be this difficult. We issue HTTPS and SSL from Let'sEncrypt -- it's 100% free, and we'll automatically handle everything for you, from installation to renewal. Let'sEncrypt is an initiative powered by some of the most established companies and organizations on the Internet, from Google to Facebook to Cisco to EFF, to make the entire web more secure. My SSL certificate expired, what should I do? Typically, SSL certificates automatically renew themselves, so if you notice that your certificate is expired, please reach out to us at support@strikingly.com or chat with us . Our team will assist you in extending the validity of your SSL certificate and ensuring that your website remains secure. Still not working? If it's been over 48 hours since you changed your domain host settings and your domain is still not loading properly on HTTPS, contact us at support@strikingly.com or chat with us and include a screenshot of your domain settings so we can help!

    "text": "Fix Problems with Masked Forwarding\n\nOn this page: What is masked forwarding? What is the problem with masked forwarding? What's the solution for masked forwarding? How can I know if masked forwarding was used or not? What is masked forwarding? Masked forwarding is hiding the actual address of a site in the address bar. This setting only lets your site visitors see the address that they originally typed in the address bar instead of the real address of the site that they are viewing. Example: You use select masked forwarding to forward yourdomain.com to http://page.strikingly.com or strikingly.com/page. When you visit yourdomain.com, the address bar shows yourdomain.com and you see your site content. However, the site looks strange on mobile. Does Strikingly Domain support mask forwarding? The answer simply is NO. Below are the reasons we do not support it. What is the problem with masked forwarding? Some domain registrars allow \"masked forwarding\" which uses a frame to include your Strikingly site onto your domain. Frames and iframes are special HTML elements that let you include one site in another site. This sounds like it would work but in fact, this causes many problems: Broken mobile site. Frames often cannot properly resize on mobile screens. This means Strikingly's mobile version won't be functional when your visitors view your site from a phone. Instead of seeing a mobile version of your site, you'll see your site displayed as how it is on a computer. Poor search engine optimization. Frames aren't smart enough to put SEO tags, images, and descriptions on the outer wrapping site, so as a result, your domain won't be able to pull that information when it gets indexed! Bad for your site's SEO. No descriptions/icons are attached to the page. If you've uploaded a Facebook share image or favicon, these settings will only apply to the inner frame, so they won't be available from the outer wrapping site. As a result, your Facebook shares will not work properly. Outbound link security. If you have any secure external links from your site -- a link to a PayPal payment page, for instance -- those links may not function properly, since the link is only activated from within the frame and not from the browser. In this case, a service like PayPal may block your transaction because it cannot verify that you're accessing the payment page through a secure browser window! OK. Frames are bad. What's the solution? We have guides to walk you through the proper way of connecting your domain to Strikingly! Click here to see how to do it . How can I know if masked forwarding was used or not? 1. Go to your domain registrar and check your domain settings. 2. Check if the site loads using the naked domain. 3. Check if the favicon load. 4.

After you’ve gone through the domain connection tutorial, refreshed, and waited for at least several minutes, you can check to see progress with this 2-step checklist. Note : Some domain registrars may take up to 48 hours to update! Double-check your settings and come back to the site later. If you'd like us to connect your domain for you, send us the info here ! If you bought a domain from Strikingly, it will automatically connect. Email support@strikingly.com if you’re having trouble. Step 1. Go to http://yourdomain.com (change yourdomain to your domain name) Does it work? If so, move to step 2! If not, keep reading: If this redirects you to http://page.strikingly.com (or www.strikingly.com/page), then you have set up domain forwarding wrong. You want to forward from yourdomain.com to www.yourdomain.com, not to your Strikingly URL! Check our domain connection tutorial here. If this tells you that no page exists or the page can’t be found, then think about what you did during your tutorial. a) If you used “A Records” at some point, it’s very likely that you have A records for yourdomain.com that don’t belong to us. You should delete the extra ones. Check our domain connection tutorial here. b) If you didn’t use “A Records”, it’s very likely that your domain forwarding isn’t set up, or is not active yet. Double-check that you’re forwarding (without masking) to www.yourdomain.com. Make sure you only have one CNAME for “www.” Check our domain connection tutorial here. Step 2. Go to http://www.yourdomain.com (change yourdomain to your domain name) Does it work? If so, you’re good to go. If not, check if you have the correct CNAME record. If this tells you that no page exists or the page can’t be found, then you probably haven’t set up a CNAME for “ www ” pointing to “ www.yourdomain.com.s.strikinglydns.com ”. a) check your spelling b) make sure you only have one CNAME for www c) you may have to wait longer This is rare to happen, but if it redirects you to http://page.strikingly.com (or www.strikingly.com/page), then you might have set up subdomain forwarding. You should be using CNAME instead! See the tutorial here. If you can see your site, but are having mobile compatibility or viewing issues… Go to “ view source .” You can do this by pressing “cmd+opt+U” on Mac, or “view” “developer tools” in the menu. If the code is longer than a couple of pages, you should be good to go! Email us with a screenshot and your question. If the code is less than a page, you are using “masked forwarding” or “framing.” This is bad for SEO, mobile compatibility , and more, so use the tutorial to connect your domain properly . Other errors If you see these pop-ups, read more: \" Framing is not allowed with a free account \" \" Domain is invalid or already taken \" Still a mystery?

    "text": "Namecheap FreeDNS / My Registrar has no DNS settings\n\nRequirement: A Premium Account from Strikingly A custom domain A Namecheap account If your domain manager panel does not have the option to edit DNS Zone File Settings but allows changing of nameservers, you can use Namecheap's FreeDNS . However, you will still need to renew your domain through your original registrar. Only DNS will be hosted in Namecheap's panel. Before you begin, do you have mail services connected to your current registrar? Copy and save those MX records before making any changes. Step 1: Get Namecheap's Nameservers. Step 2: Change Your Domain Registrar's Nameservers. Step 3: Set up DNS records on Namecheap Step 1: Get Namecheap's Nameservers. Log in to your Namecheap account or sign up. Hover over the \"Domains\" tab at the navigation bar and click the \"FreeDNS\" option. Add your domain to the field and click the \"Get DNS\" button. Click on the \"Shopping Cart\" icon on the next window, then click the \"Set up DNS\" button. You'll be redirected to a page showing the nameservers which you have to set up on your domain registrar's panel. Step 2: Change Your Domain Registrar's Nameservers. Sign in to your domain registrar. Change the nameservers settings at your current Registrar within 10 days to the following ones: freedns1.registrar-servers.com freedns2.registrar-servers.com freedns3.registrar-servers.com freedns4.registrar-servers.com freedns5.registrar-servers.com You may have to wait for about a few minutes up to 48 hours for the domain to point to Namecheap. Namecheap will also try to verify if your domain is correctly pointed to its nameservers by monitoring your domain's DNS settings. FreeDNS service will be activated once Namecheap verifies. If in case you prefer other ways to use the FreeDNS, you can follow this guide instead for the TXT records and email authorization options. Step 3: Set up DNS records on Namecheap Follow this article to complete setup: Connecting a Namecheap Domain to your Strikingly site .

    "text": "Use Root Domain as Main URL (via Cloudflare)\n\nNote: We do not recommend using Cloudflare as a solution for HTTPS. However, if you prefer to use your root domain ( yourdomain.com ) instead of the www domain ( www.yourdomain.com ) as the main domain for your Strikingly site, you can achieve this by adding a CNAME record for the root domain. Requirement: A Premium Account from Strikingly A custom domain (if you don't have a domain yet, you can purchase one from us ) A Cloudflare account Do you want to use your root domain (yourdomain.com) as your main domain for your Strikingly site instead of the www domain (www.yourdomain.com)? You can do that by adding a CNAME record for the root domain. If your domain registrar does not allow this setup, you can use Cloudflare DNS settings. This guide will walk you through it. Step 1: Connect to Your Custom Domain on Strikingly Step 2: Add Your Domain to Cloudflare Step 3: Add a CNAME record on Cloudflare Step 4: Change Your Domain's Nameserver on your Registrar Step 5: Set up a URL forwarding with Cloudflare Page Rules Step 6: Wait for the records to take effect Step 1: Connect to Your Custom Domain on Strikingly 1.

(without https:// or http:// or /). 3. Click \"UPDATE\". Note: Type your domain in lowercase to avoid the \" Page not found \" error when accessing your site Step 2: Add Your Domain to Cloudflare 1. Sign in to your Cloudflare account or sign up if you don't have one (it's free). 2. Click \" +Add site \" (if you just sign up, you can skip this). 3. Enter your site: 4. Select the free plan and Click \" Continue \". 5. Wait for Cloudflare to finish scanning for existing DNS records. Step 3: Add a CNAME record on Cloudflare 1. Look for existing CNAME and A records for www. 2. Delete the existing CNAME and A records (only for www). 3. Click \" +Add record\" . 4. In the \"Type\" field, select CNAME 5. In the \"Name\" field, enter @ 6. In the \"Target\" field, enter cf-dns.strikingly.com 7. Make sure the cloud under \"Proxy status\" is in orange . 8. Click \"Save\". 9. Click \" Continue \". Step 4: Change Your Domain's Nameserver on your Registrar 1. You will be redirected to a guide on how to change your nameservers. 2. Sign in to your domain registrar. 3. Change the nameserver to Cloudflare's. 4. Wait for the nameserver update. It can take a few hours to 24 hours. 5. Once it's done, you can click \" Done, check nameservers \". Step 5: Add an A record for www and Set up a URL forwarding with Cloudflare Page Rules 1. Go back to your Cloudflare account. 2. Click on \" Website \" then click on \" DNS \". 3.

Select your list > Save and Deploy . Step 6: Wait for the records to take effect Now that you've set up the domain records. Please allow a few up to 48 hours for the changes in the domain records to take effect globally. Be sure to clear your browser cache before you check to see if the domain is working. Note: We do not recommend using Cloudflare as a solution to HTTPS anymore. However, if you still want to use your root domain (yourdomain.com) as your main domain for your Strikingly site instead of the www domain (www.yourdomain.com), you can do that by adding a CNAME record for the root domain. Do this at your own risk, as this solution may prevent your other DNS records such as MX records from working properly. If your site doesn't go online after 48 hours, contact us at support@strikingly.com or chat with us and include a screenshot of your domain settings, so we can help!",
